<h4>PHOTOGRAPHS AND VIDEOS OF STUDENTS IN SCHOOL PUBLICATIONS</h4>
<p>It is the practice of the school to document school events with photographs
and videos, which are published on our official media platforms (both online
and hard copy publications) – such as our website, termly newsletter, yearbook,
official social media accounts and publicity materials – as well as on
posters and banners within our premises and on our external wall.</p>
<p>Photographs or video images of you or your legal guardians may be taken
during school activities and events such as classroom lessons, CCA, school
camps, or school concerts. The school may use and publish such photographs
or video recordings in school publications, the school’s website, social
media channels, or other communication channels.</p>
<p>We wish to assure you that we will always portray our students with respect
and dignity. We will also ensure no personal information or identification
of your child will be made with the pictures (with the exception of the
school yearbook and/or newsletter quarterly which are hardcopy publications).
If specific identification of your child is required on any other publications,
your consent will be sought first.</p>
<p>We seek your cooperation to acknowledge your consent to such use, which
will be in force for the years of your child’s education journey with us
at secondary school. If you have any queries, please email us at&nbsp;
