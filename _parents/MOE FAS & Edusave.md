<h4>ENHANCED EDUSAVE AND MOE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE SCHEMES AND REVISED MISCELLANEOUS FEES STRUCTURE FROM 2024</h4>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>To enhance the affordability of education for Singaporean primary to pre-university
students, MOE will be enhancing the Edusave Scheme and MOE Financial Assistance
Scheme (FAS) to fully cover all miscellaneous fees from 1 January 2024.
This allows parents to reduce out-of-pocket expenses for their children’s
educational needs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From 1 January 2024, the standard miscellaneous fee and second-tier miscellaneous
fee will be merged into a single-tier miscellaneous fee to simplify the
fee structure. The single-tier miscellaneous fee will be the sum of the
current two tiers (see Annex), and can be fully paid for by Edusave. There
is no change to the total miscellaneous fees payable for your child.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The single-tier miscellaneous fee will be deducted from your child/ward’s
Edusave if authorisation had been given earlier to use his/her Edusave
Account to pay the second-tier miscellaneous fee. No action is required
from you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If your child/ward is currently not using the Edusave Account and you
wish to use Edusave to pay for the single-tier miscellaneous fee, you can
sign up through the Edusave Standing Order (SO) icon under the Services
tab in Parents Gateway (PG) app, or through <a href="https://go.gov.sg/moe-edusave-signup" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://go.gov.sg/moe-edusave-signup</a>.
Alternatively, you may continue to pay via GIRO or other e-payment options
available.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If your child/ward is under the MOE FAS from 2024, it will fully cover
the single-tier miscellaneous fee.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The guide on setting up the Edusave SO in PG is in the attached file.
