#### Mother’s Day Appreciation – ‘Sweet Gratitude’

The school organised a Mother’s day Appreciation activity where students made bouquets for their mothers and grandmothers to show their affection and express their gratitude and appreciation to their mothers and grandmothers. The Parent Support Group was pivotal in the success of the event guiding students in the bouquet-making activity. Kudos to the parent volunteers and the student participants. 

#### Feedback from parents

*It was very sweet to receive a Mother’s Day flower from my son! He is my pillar of support.*

*My child was very proud and excited to see me volunteering in her school. She brought her friends over and introduced me to them. My child saw that I was interested and willing to support in her teenage journey and school life hence she is willing to let me stay involved in her current journey. This is truely a rewarding experience for both the parent and child.*
