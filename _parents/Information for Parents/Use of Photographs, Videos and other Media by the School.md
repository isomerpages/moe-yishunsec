**PHOTOGRAPHS AND VIDEOS OF STUDENTS IN SCHOOL PUBLICATIONS**

It is the practice of the school to document school events with photographs and videos, which are published on our official media platforms (both online and hard copy publications) – such as our website, termly newsletter, yearbook, official social media accounts and publicity materials – as well as on posters and banners within our premises and on our external wall.

Photographs or video images of you or your legal guardians may be taken during school activities and events such as classroom lessons, CCA, school camps, or school concerts. The school may use and publish such photographs or video recordings in school publications, the school’s website, social media channels, or other communication channels.

We wish to assure you that we will always portray our students with respect and dignity. We will also ensure no personal information or identification of your child will be made with the pictures (with the exception of the school yearbook and/or newsletter quarterly which are hardcopy publications). If specific identification of your child is required on any other publications, your consent will be sought first.

We seek your cooperation to acknowledge your consent to such use, which will be in force for the years of your child’s education journey with us at secondary school. If you have any queries, please email us at [yishun\_ss@moe.edu.sg.](mailto:yishun_ss@moe.edu.sg)
