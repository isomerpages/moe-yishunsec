### Department Goal(s)

To develop students’ numeracy skills through logical reasoning, communicating and applications of concepts in the real life and to achieve our department vision of every **student will excel and appreciate Mathematics.**

### Department Key Programmes

* To provide various platform and opportunities for students to develop the love for Mathematics, authentic learning experiences and games are introduced at the lower secondary level. 
* Interdisciplinary projects are introduced to help students related to the learning of Mathematics alongside other subjects. 
* Educational platform such as Geogebra and Desmos are infused in the curriculum to help students with visualisation of geometrical properties. 

### External Collaboration and Partnership

* **Coding Programme and National Digital Explorer (NDE):** <br> 
Selected from Sec 1 to 3 students took part in 10-hour coding programme and Sec 2 G3 math students took part in NDE to learn and certify in LSCEP through flipped learning approach at their own phase. 

* **Singapore and Asian School Math Olympiad (SASMO):** <br>
Our teachers trained students from Sec 1E, 2E and 3E. The competition allowed them to learn independently and stretch their thinking skills in non-routine questions. We have clinched 1 Gold, 7 Bronze Awards and 7 Honorable Mention.

* **Math Challenge at Ngee Ann Polytechnic** aims to relate Mathematics and engineering to real life situation via exciting games, as well as promote teamwork and quick-thinking for the students.

* **Mathemagics by Dr Arthur Benjamin** aims to arouse students’ interest in mathematics and to develop mathematical reasoning, logical, creative, and critical thinking. Students enjoyed his sharing and his secrets for performing rapid mental calculations.

* **NIE Mathematics Challenge for Sec 1:**  This is online Math quiz that is closely aligned to the current secondary Mathematics syllabus. We have achieved 5 distinction awardees.

* **All Singapore Secondary Mathematics Competition For Normal Course Students:** To stimulate greater interest and enrich students’ knowledge in Mathematics for Sec 2 and Sec 3 students in Normal Academic and Normal Technical. Our students proudly clinched the 8th and 14th position for <u>**Individual Award and 4th position in Team Award**.</u>
