### Highlights / Achievements

#### Programme: 

**Beyond Classroom Experience: Molecular Gastronomy Workshop @ the Singapore Science Centre:**

In Term 2, all sec 3 students attended the Molecular Gastronomy Workshop. The Science Department organised this learning experience to help students recognise the importance of science and technology in food. Through this experience, students learnt different techniques to create food that combines science and art. This allows them to understand the chemistry behind various cooking methods.

#### Achievements: 

**Illustratum 2023:**

Illustratum 2023 competition organised by NUS Physics provides a platform for enthusiasts to present complex concepts in a way that captivates and engages. It also fosters curiosity, develops creative and critical thinking as well as a long-life passion for science exploration in students. 

It is the first time that Yishun Secondary School has participated in the competition and one of the team - YISHUN SEC TEAM 2 has clinched the Distinction Award. We competed against schools such as NUS High School of Mathematics and Science, School of Science and Technology and Nanyang Girls’ High School. The awardees are from 3E2: Mohammad Danish Aiman Bin Mohammad Rizal, Chai Chung You Jeremy and Chin Jun Hong Alfred. The other team, YISHUN SEC TEAM 1 from 3E1 Loh Qian Ting, Jaydias Ng Ke Cheng and Vrion Chan received the Certificate of Participation Award.
