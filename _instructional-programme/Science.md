### Goal(s)

* To cultivate the joy of learning Science by developing studentsâ€™ knowledge, skills and attitudes in scientific-thinking through a well-designed curriculum that focuses on scientific inquiry and authentic learning.

* To prepare students for a life-long passion in learning Science and enable them to innovate and contribute to a technologically-driven society.

### Key Programmes

Beyond Classroom Experience: A variety of science-based activities that exposes students to science beyond the textbook in different environments.

### Highlights / Achievements (focusing on learning experiences / processes)

Our teachers used a variety of platforms such as Google Classroom, Nearpod and Pear Deck during home-based learning to engage students and check on their understanding. Students also participated in inter-school competitions National Olympiads as well as in national level competitions such as the National Crystal Growing Challenge and Singapore Science Buskers, stretching their learning at the highest level.
