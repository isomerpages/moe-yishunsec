## Goal

To nurture students into thinkers, innovators, and contributors

## Key Programmes

Craft and Technology subjects (Art, Design & Technology, Food & Nutrition, Food Studies, Food & Consumer Education) are aligned to the 21st Century Competencies required by students to be thinkers, innovators and contributors. Through coursework, students are exposed to thinking and innovation techniques such as project management, art awareness and appreciation, nutrition planning, problems identification, research, decision making, empathy and safety consciousness so that they are able to contribute to the community.

**DESIGN & TECHNOLOGY** adopts the Design Thinking process to explore real-world design opportunities and students propose ideas based on their research and ideation.  Students’ thinking is cultivated through different methods of sketching and drawing, questioning techniques and the joy of learning by using real-life authentic situations coupled with computer-aided design software for product design on structures and designs.  These activities, together with mini projects, enable students to experience authentic design opportunities with empathy and critical thinking, thus honing their problem-solving skills.

**D&T Programme**

**Lower Secondary Programme**

The programme focuses to create interest and awareness in design at the lower secondary level through:

* exposure to elements of the design process,
* basic 3D sketching,
* understanding technological areas in structures, mechanisms and electronics,
* hands-on projects that allow individual creativity and problem-solving.

**Upper Secondary Programme**

At the upper secondary level, the aim is to inculcate creativity and innovative spirit through:

* involvement in the rigour of the design process through the building up of a design journal,
* acquiring skills, making of mock-ups and prototypes, and production of presentation boards,
* development of advanced workshop process skills.

***Lower Secondary Programme***

At the lower secondary level, students are exposed to not only 2-dimensional art-making. Students get to develop their visual-spatial intelligence through the mixed medium sculptures.  These enable students to immerse and explore 3-dimensional constructs to communicate their thoughts, ideas and be adept at understanding and appreciating the form of an object.  This is to cultivate a sense of wonder whilst enjoying the process of discovery.

***Upper Secondary Programme***

At the upper secondary level, the focus is on Studio Practice. Studio Practice engages students in the creation of artworks. Students hone their observation skills, learn to discriminate visual qualities and give form to their ideas and experiences when they are engaged in art making. The Studio Practice provides opportunities for students to acquire a working understanding of various art elements and principles. It also develops competency in manipulating various art media for self-expression. Students would be given opportunities to explore a good range of media and experiment with different techniques in their studio practice.

<b style="color:blue">NUTRITION & FOOD SCIENCE</b> develops students’ critical thinking and culinary skills as they apply their learning to contribute towards the community.  The experiences promote an extension of learning and inventive thinking where students look into emerging food and health trends, examine the different characteristics of food, investigate and apply scientific principles for food preparation, before making informed decisions in designing and creating innovative health-enhancing food products to contribute positively to the community.

***Lower Secondary Food & Consumer Education***

The lower secondary Food & Consumer Education (FCE) programme focuses on:
* understanding the importance of nutrition for long-term health and applying basic principles of consumer education,
* nurturing and developing a spirit of enterprise, innovation, aesthetic awareness, problem-solving and creativity,
* inventive thinking where students look into emerging food and health trends,
* appreciating and developing an understanding of food and multicultural literacy in the global context,
* making informed decisions in designing and creating innovative health-enhancing food products to contribute positively to the community.

***Upper Secondary Food & Nutrition***

The upper secondary Food & Nutrition (F&N) programme delves at a deeper level on:

* the principles of nutrition and concept of a balanced diet in meal planning using nutritional tools and modification of recipes,
* examining the different characteristics of food,
* investigating and applying scientific principles for food preparation,
* developing critical thinking and culinary skills as they apply their learning in solving diet-related health problems.


As a department, various ways are explored to give back to the Community:

* Collaboration with PAssionArt to spruce up the community with Artwork as well as co-organizing community events
* Working with community activity centres through Service Learning, and
* Designing with a Purpose through designing and making toys, in support of the Art unit’s community work

### Highlights / Achievements

* The department uses a variety of technologies to engage students like 3D Pen for art sculpturing, ICT tools like Google Apps, Canva, Miro Board, videos for FCE / F&N, and prototyping, ICT tools like Google apps, SketchBook, videos, and micro:bit for D&T.
* MOE D&T Awards in Creative Innovation (Tan Jia Jin) and Creative Adaptation (Wu Jiajun) were awarded.
* Claudine Toh En Ya of 4E3 (2021)’s entry was shortlisted for D&T Awards 2022.
* Art works exhibited at the Singapore Youth Festival 2020 online exhibition.
