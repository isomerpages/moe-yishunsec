### Goal
To develop every student to be a creative, innovative and collaborative life–long learner.

### Key Programmes

Our department seeks to provide our students with authentic learning experiences as well as expose them to varied career and education options:

<u><b>Music and Mother Tongue Broadcasting Collaboration</b></u>

The broadcasting collaboration gave Secondary One students an opportunity to create music through technology and to understand the use of music in news broadcast.

<u><b>Flea Market</b></u>

This event provided a more authentic learning experience for the Secondary Three and Secondary Four Retail Operation students. The students managed the logistics, sales and marketing for the whole flea market experience.

<u><b>Partnerships with External Organizations</b></u>

These partnerships provide more authentic learning experiences for the Secondary Three Retail Operation students as well as selected music students. They also allow for more internship opportunities in the retail sectors and masterclasses to learn from the music professionals.

### Highlights / Achievements

<u><b>iPad Band Performance at Sree Narayana Mission Home (SNMH)</b></u>

Selected Secondary Two students performed for the residents at SNMH and taught them how to make music on the iPad.
