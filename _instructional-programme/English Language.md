Under this initiative, one book will be donated to selected beneficiaries for every 10 people who read for 15 minutes. As part of the Zoom Read Together, the students signed up for topics of interest ranging from fiction to non-fiction and joined the read-together sessions where librarians hosted the read-together sessions via Zoom and shared their thoughts on the topic along with their favourite book recommendations.
* <b>KidsREAD 2022: </b>Our school collaborates with the National Library Board in this programme where 20 of our students volunteer weekly at Jiemin Primary School to read to the Lower Primary students in an effort to promote the love of reading and cultivate good reading habits among young Singaporeans.
