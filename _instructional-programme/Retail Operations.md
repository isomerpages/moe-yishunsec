### Goal

To develop every student to be a creative, innovative and collaborative lifeâ€“long learner.

### Key Programmes

Our department seeks to provide our students with authentic learning experiences as well as expose them to varied career and education options:

#### Flea Market

This event provided a more authentic learning experience for the Secondary Three and Secondary Four Retail Operation students. The students managed the logistics, sales and marketing for the whole flea market experience.

#### Partnerships with External Organizations

These partnerships provide more authentic learning experiences for the Secondary Three Retail Operation students as well as selected music students. They also allow for more internship opportunities in the retail sectors and masterclasses to learn from the music professionals.
