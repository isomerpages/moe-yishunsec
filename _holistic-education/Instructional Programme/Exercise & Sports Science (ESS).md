Exercise & Sports Science is a new GCE O-Level subject to be introduced in 2022. ESS uses movement as the focal point for performance, analysis and critique. Students will understand the relationships amongst the sub-disciplines of sports science and how systems within these sub-disciplines interact to influence how the human body moves in relation to each other and in different contexts. Movement contexts exist in specific exercises and sports, which in turn, manifest themselves in why and how people exercise and participate in sports in society, as influenced by socio-cultural factors such as commercialisation, ethics and equity.

### Aims of the Syllabus

1. Acquire and apply the knowledge in exercise physiology, biomechanics, and sports psychology to analyse, evaluate and improve practical performances in physical exercises and sports; 
2. Develop the movement concepts and motor skills to be proficient in the performance of a team and an individual / dual sport; 
3. Understand the benefits and risks associated with physical exercise and sports to manage personal participation in physical activities; and 
4. Examine issues related to sports and participation in physical activities from socio-cultural and global perspectives.
