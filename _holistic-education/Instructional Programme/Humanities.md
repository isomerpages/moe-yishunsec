### Department Goal

The Humanities Department strives to develop inquisitive learners who are able to appreciate and question the world they live in with the hope to groom empathetic and informed global citizens.

Through engaging experiences in the Humanities classroom and the supplementation of the Key Initiatives, students draw connections between their own lived experiences and the larger national, regional and global events that shape the world we live in. The use of inquiry as the main anchor for the classroom experience allows the student space to think critically, ask questions and make reasoned judgements. This is demonstrated in day-to-day conversations with the students and also through commendable competition results such as achieving a Certificate of Achievement (Bronze) for the NUS Geography Challenge and coming in 2nd place for the NLB S.U.R.E. competition.

### Department Key Initiatives

##### Humanities Inquiry

The inquiry process, whereby students are guided through the ability to ask questions about the content they are learning and draw conclusions from sources of information, forms the core of the Humanities. To support this process of inquiry, each unit has designed engaging learning journeys that will allow students to learn beyond the confines of their classroom and to apply their learning to the actual real-world context. Learning journeys include: 

1. Sec 1 Historical Investigation to Eurasian Heritage Gallery, Indian Heritage Centre and Sun Yat Sen Nanyang Memorial Hall 
2. Sec 3 Pure Geography Investigation at East Coast Beach 
3. Sec 3 Social Studies Investigation at The Enabling Village
		

##### Humanities Talent Management

Year-round, students from across the various levels and streams are selected to represent the school in competitions. Most notable ones include the NUS Geography Challenge, NLB S.U.R.E competition, Historical Scene Investigation and the MOE History challenge. 

##### Southeast Asian Programme

Every year, a group of Secondary 2 students are selected to take part in the Southeast Asian Programme where they learn more about the region they live in through talks by academics as well as sharing by their peers on how the interconnection between Southeast Asian countries are vital to the survival of this region. This year, they will also embark on interactive sessions such as trying their hands on the Gamelan and Batik painting as they learn about the deep cultural heritage of the region. They will also be going on a learning journey to the National Gallery Singapore where they will learn more about art and architecture that defines Southeast Asia.
