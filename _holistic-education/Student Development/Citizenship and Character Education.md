### Highlights / Achievements

A wide array of learning platforms and experiences are brought to our students to collectively build our students’ character and citizenship. Our department provides opportunities for our students to transfer their learning and to put good values and skills into action. This facilitates the internalisation of good values and skills which are critical to character and citizenship development. The key highlights for the year include:

* <b>Stronger Together Activities:</b> The myriad of activities which rallied Yishunites to pay tribute to frontliners, Foreign workers and many more. Students showed their appreciation and support to one another by preparing Care Packages, notes and videos of appreciation pledging to stand together during a challenging phase this year.

#### Secondary 1 Welcome Tea Party for International, Permanent Resident and Returning Singaporean students

A ‘Welcome Tea Party’ for International Students and Permanent Resident (ISPR) as well as returning Singaporean students from Secondary 1 to mingle with NE &amp; VIA Champs of their classes, was held on Friday 24 February. There were three Secondary 2 students who joined in, returning Singaporeans (two students) and newly transferred in to our school (one student). Their class NE &amp; VIA Champs were also invited. 
The session started with the introduction of why they were selected for the welcome party and the aim of the programme. The students were then asked to introduce themselves and share one fun fact about themselves. 

They proceed to paint on canvas using acrylic paints and used wires to form words to be pasted on the canvas. Students had curry puffs, egg tarts, soyabean and grass jelly drinks to bond over food. The finale was ‘The Red Dot’ Kahoot quiz testing how much they know about the places, culture and history of Singapore. The top three winners were presented with a prize each!  

The students had fun and bonded well with each other in the group. Following up from this session, the NE &amp; VIA Champs will be sharing what they have learnt (through interview) about the food, festival or culture from the origin country of their ISPR classmates while the ISPR students will be sharing about their experience in Singapore or their perspective of what makes Singapore, Singapore. The video clips will be compiled and featured during IFD celebration in April.

#### Racial Harmony Day (RHD) Celebration 2022

The celebration aims to foster respect and appreciation to the customs and traditions of the different races and religions to coexist harmoniously.

The school commemorated RHD on 21 July 2022. The theme is ‘Singapore: Our Multicultural Mosaic’.  
Students were engaged in a skit entitled “Perfect Harmony’ during assembly. The skit depicts uniqueness of each individual and value of staying connected as a united community. First segment showed how the passion of two musicians, traditional kompang player and contemporary hip-hop rapper connects them together. Second segment was done in masks reflected how black cats are considered ‘superstitiously dangerous. 

During CCE period, students constructed digital photo collages to depict their views of Singapore as a multicultural mosaic. The activity acts as a common space for students with different backgrounds to forge a greater bonding. Prior to this, students explored places of worship, hawker centers etc. to take photos that reflect multicultural community in the aspects of lifestyle, food, architecture. 

Teachers engaged students to address ‘racism’ which may occur in schools, public spaces and online platforms. Through facilitation of authentic sharing of personal experiences shown in the case studies, students were able to think from different perspectives and look beyond racial markers. 

As part of the celebration, three types of childhood snacks were catered. They are eyeglass candy, dried fish fillet and muruku ikan snack. While it brings back memories of their school and neighbourhood, the shared connections among multicultural communities would be something for students to reminisce about.

### Total Defence Day (TDD) Commemoration 2022

The commemoration serves to imbue students with commitment to build a cohesive society who is ready to face the future together and to have a collective will to keep Singapore safe and secure. 
    
As a continuation from previous years, the theme “Together We Keep Singapore Strong” encourages students to play a greater role in Total Defence by showing them how they can contribute in small and big ways.

During CCE period, Sec 4 and 5 students presented their VIA Projects which focused on pillars of defense to the Sec 1, 2 and 3 classes. The junior students consolidated their learning and reflections through activities and worksheets designed by their seniors. After the session, PowerPoint slides curated by the Sec 4 and 5 students were screened at the library as part of VIA showcase during all recess timings. Pull-up banners and A3 posters from Singapore Red Cross were displayed in the library as well.

On 15 February 2022, students were presented with the sounding of public warning system (PWS) siren followed by a sharing on what is PWS and its significance, via Zoom in individual classrooms. The TDD video message by Minister for Defence, Dr Ng Eng Hen was screened following that.

Next, lesson on how digital threats impact individuals and the nation was conducted with the use of Straits Times IN TDD edition. Students were also engaged through the screening of SGStory film entitled ‘Missed Calls’, courtesy from Singapore Discovery Centre. The story revolves around a JC1 student, Jeanine who lost her grandfather to Covid-19. The moral of the story encourages students to adopt resilience in overcoming challenges against Covid-19 to emerge stronger as one community.

### Nee Soon Central Well-Wishes Project 2022 @ Nee Soon Central Community Club

The ceremony serves as an encouragement for students to keep up their academic grades, as part of the effort in removing all barriers to learning. Deserving students were selected based on their residency within the Nee Soon Central Constituency. 

On 14 July 2022, a stationery gift set presentation ceremony was held at Function Room 2 of Nee Soon Central Community Club. The Well-Wishes Project is supported by Nee Soon Central CC Welfare Committee. The committee has worked with the school to determine the stationery items needed by students at each level. This ensures that the stationery items selected could meet the needs of the recipients.  

At 4pm, the ceremony started with registration and refreshments. By 4:25pm, all guests were seated. The two student emcees for the day were Aljon Tok from class 3E2 and Ahmad Danish from class 3E5. Mr. Tan, our Vice-Principal, gave his opening address. This is followed by Grassroots Adviser Associate Professor Faishal Ibrahim’s welcome address.  

Next, Associate Professor Faishal Ibrahim presented the gift sets to students, joined by their parents or guardians who were present. The school would like to express our heartfelt thanks to Associate Professor Faishal Ibrahim for making this event possible. As a token of appreciation from the school, Mr. Tan presented a handcrafted wooden pen holder designed and made by our very own Design and Technology teachers and students. The wooden pen holder symbolises the eagerness of Yishunites to learn and lead compassionately. This is in alignment with the collective effort of Yishunites in building a school community of ‘quality mind and caring heart’.  

The presentation ceremony ended with a group photo taking session on stage.

### Secondary 3 NRIC Presentation Ceremony 2022

The ceremony serves to honour and represents privilege of the citizenship. It is to re-affirm our loyalty and allegiance to Singapore.

On 14 July 2022, during CCE period, all Sec 3 students gathered at the school hall to receive their National Registration Identity Card (NRIC). The ceremony started with a briefing on the background information of NRIC. Among the information shared were the security features found on the NRIC, the mystery behind the NRIC number and the changes to the NRIC from its first introduced paper version to the current convenient credit-card sized made from polycarbonate material.  

After which, a video that show the long journey of how a foreign resident, Alexander Alrivers was finally offered citizenship and received his pink NRIC was screened. Students felt emotional for his ‘big’ moment and were touched by his determination.    

Next, Mr. Tay, our Vice-Principal, presented the NRIC for the class monitors and assistant monitors. 
The ceremony ended with the presentation of NRICs by Form Teachers to the students, where students sign on the ICA acknowledgement form after collection. 

Receiving NRIC is an important milestone for Singapore citizens. The citizenship status should not be taken for granted. It is hoped that the experience will be an encouragement for students to play their role well as Singapore citizens, having a deeper understanding and a greater sense of belonging to our nation!
