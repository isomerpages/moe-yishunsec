### Highlights / Achievements

A wide array of learning platforms and experiences are brought to our students to collectively build our students’ character and citizenship. Our department provides opportunities for our students to transfer their learning and to put good values and skills into action. This facilitates the internalisation of good values and skills which are critical to character and citizenship development. The key highlights for the year include:

* <b>Stronger Together Activities:</b> The myriad of activities which rallied Yishunites to pay tribute to frontliners, Foreign workers and many more. Students showed their appreciation and support to one another by preparing Care Packages, notes and videos of appreciation pledging to stand together during a challenging phase this year.
* <b>Care &amp; Support programmes for students:</b> Our students were involved in projects that spread kindness and support to one another. Our Singapore Kindness Movement Ambassadors led these projects and brought much warmth to the school population.

Our school also received the following awards:

* <b>North-West CDC Partners Award (Silver)</b> in recognition of our school’s efforts in serving the community
* <b>Singapore Kindness Movement Award 2019 </b>– Certificate of Participation (11 Years)

#### Education and Career Guidance – Work Exposure &amp; Experience Programme 

In line with the national movement of SkillsFuture, the school organised the  Work Exposure &amp; Experience programme for our Secondary 3 students. During the programme, the students are exposed to real work environments where they can discover their passion, learn about specific industries and how the workplace deals with challenges whilst developing their interpersonal and communication skills.

During the June holidays, 25 Sec 3 and Sec 4 students participated in a 3 to 5-day Work Exposure &amp; Experience Programme at 5 organisations. 

The students found the programme useful in gaining first-hand knowledge on the industry, career opportunities and related work skills/ work values. 


#### Reflections from student

“At the office, I really had to go out of my comfort zone and learn the administrative duties. I had to be independent in the assigned task. I learnt that other than going to court, lawyers had to focus on a lot of administrative duties. It was indeed a steep learning curve these 5 days for me, learning new phrases, digesting a lot of information that was necessary for preparing for court hearings but I enjoyed the learning so much”  ~ Nur Shafiqah, 3N2 (Attached to Tembusu Law)

“Some of the assigned task were very tedious such as cutting resources. But, I loved the classroom experience. It was really fun. We had to help out with various activities for the children.” ~ Ramesh Marimuthu Dharshini, 3E4 (Attached to Julia Gabriels Centre)

“I learnt that besides being patient when preparing resources for the children, pre-school teachers need to be creative in designing resources and activities for the children” ~ Emily Loh, 3E1 (Attached to Julia Gabriels Centre)

“I wish to go back to Superpets during my holidays for a part-time job. I actually asked the boss if I can go back to help them out again. I enjoyed interacting with customers, helping them to assemble the pet accessories they purchased” ~  Marcus 3E1 (Attached to Superpets)

#### Secondary 1 Welcome Tea Party for International, Permanent Resident and Returning Singaporean students

A ‘Welcome Tea Party’ for International Students and Permanent Resident (ISPR) as well as returning Singaporean students from Secondary 1 to mingle with NE &amp; VIA Champs of their classes, was held on Friday 24 February. There were three Secondary 2 students who joined in, returning Singaporeans (two students) and newly transferred in to our school (one student). Their class NE &amp; VIA Champs were also invited. 
The session started with the introduction of why they were selected for the welcome party and the aim of the programme. The students were then asked to introduce themselves and share one fun fact about themselves. 

They proceed to paint on canvas using acrylic paints and used wires to form words to be pasted on the canvas. Students had curry puffs, egg tarts, soyabean and grass jelly drinks to bond over food. The finale was ‘The Red Dot’ Kahoot quiz testing how much they know about the places, culture and history of Singapore. The top three winners were presented with a prize each!  

The students had fun and bonded well with each other in the group. Following up from this session, the NE &amp; VIA Champs will be sharing what they have learnt (through interview) about the food, festival or culture from the origin country of their ISPR classmates while the ISPR students will be sharing about their experience in Singapore or their perspective of what makes Singapore, Singapore. The video clips will be compiled and featured during IFD celebration in April.

#### Racial Harmony Day (RHD) Celebration 2022

The celebration aims to foster respect and appreciation to the customs and traditions of the different races and religions to coexist harmoniously.

The school commemorated RHD on 21 July 2022. The theme is ‘Singapore: Our Multicultural Mosaic’.  
Students were engaged in a skit entitled “Perfect Harmony’ during assembly. The skit depicts uniqueness of each individual and value of staying connected as a united community. First segment showed how the passion of two musicians, traditional kompang player and contemporary hip-hop rapper connects them together. Second segment was done in masks reflected how black cats are considered ‘superstitiously dangerous. 

During CCE period, students constructed digital photo collages to depict their views of Singapore as a multicultural mosaic. The activity acts as a common space for students with different backgrounds to forge a greater bonding. Prior to this, students explored places of worship, hawker centers etc. to take photos that reflect multicultural community in the aspects of lifestyle, food, architecture. 

Teachers engaged students to address ‘racism’ which may occur in schools, public spaces and online platforms. Through facilitation of authentic sharing of personal experiences shown in the case studies, students were able to think from different perspectives and look beyond racial markers. 

As part of the celebration, three types of childhood snacks were catered. They are eyeglass candy, dried fish fillet and muruku ikan snack. While it brings back memories of their school and neighbourhood, the shared connections among multicultural communities would be something for students to reminisce about.
