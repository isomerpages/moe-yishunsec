Dear Alumni of YSS, 

Teachers' Day is around the corner! However, due to the upcoming Presidential Elections, there will be changes to school operating hours. As such, the school will be open for alumni to visit their teachers on **29 August 2023, 2:30pm - 4:30pm**. 

Prior arrangements with your teachers should be made to avoid disappointment. May you have a great time catching up with your teachers!
