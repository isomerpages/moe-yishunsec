*"Traveling without our family for the first time was both exhilarating and nerve-wrecking! Although the thought of being in a whole different country without them might be scary, this experience offers me a chance to build confidence and become independent. At the same time, it opens new doors to understanding knowledge of other cultures and new friendships too!"*

*"Watching the water puppet show was a truly unique experience. The soothing music and the captivating folk stories immediately drew me in, despite the language barrier. The actors' expressive movements and the well-coordinated puppetry conveyed the narrative clearly. It was fascinating to know that the talented actors were hidden behind a massive tent, yet their skills brought the puppets to life. Originating from Northern Vietnam and traditionally performed in the North, the art has found its way to Ho Chi Minh City. I even attempted to manipulate a fish-shaped water puppet myself, which initially felt quite challenging, but once I got the hang of it, controlling the puppet and performing tricks became easier. Although we were not seated in the front rows, I couldn't stop myself from pretending to deflect the occasional water splashes created by the skilled puppet masters."* ~ Areef (3E1)

*"The most memorable part of today was going to the war remnants museum. Seeing the photos of what had happened to the civilians made me realise how important it is to speak up about war as well as remembering the sacrifices that were made, even in the context of Singapore."* ~ Cheyenne (3E4)

*One interesting thing I learnt from the coconut candy making is that Singapore and Vietnam are interconnected as in both countries fusion fruits can be found. In Vietnam, coconut is made into chewy candy. There are also  a variety of flavours and colours. This is very similar to coconut candies such as Hu Zhen Long candies. Instead of only coconut flavor, mangosteen and durian flavor candies are sold in Singapore.* ~ Natasha 3N2

*Being able to visit Mekong Delta and actually experience riding the boat and trying out the different tidbits like the coconut candy and the natural honey was undoubtedly a once-in-a-lifetime experience. I was able to enjoy the scenic beauty and at the same time appreciate the nature and food the Vietnamese eat. It also gave me exposure to different parts of the country and i really enjoyed the trip to Mekong Delta.* ~ Valerie 3E1

*"Visiting the consulate has taught me many connections as to how Vietnam and Singapore are linked to each other and the different methods to help if any of us encounter trouble or require assistance. The Consular-General also enriched us with knowledge about the importance of establishing a good diplomatic relations with each other as they enable each other to develop."* ~ Jayden 3E3

*"Today was a meaningful and memorable day. This morning, we went to Giong Ong To High School. We got to communicate with the students there and know more about their culture as well as their school life. When we first entered the school, we got to watch a competition between two classes where they had to dance as a class. Everyone was so energetic, even the audience cheering them on. Next, we went on a short school tour. we got to look at some artworks made from the Geography students, then we went to each level, to look at the different room in the school. We even walked pass some classrooms and the students were so friendly, they waved  back at us. Next, we went into the Innovation room where we would meet students from Giong Ong To and bonding with them even more. Firstly, a student from Giong Ong To performed for us a song call 'Hello Vietnam'. Next, we got to meet our Vietnamese buddies. They were very friendly and welcoming to us starting conversations getting us to know each other  even better. Secondly, we performed the 2016 national day song, ' Tomorrow's Here Today' and we performed a famous Vietnamese song that trended on Tiktok. Secondly, my favourite, we got to decorate our very own conical hat together with our buddies. That's when we bonded even more laughing and having fun while decorating the hats. Lastly, we had a gift exchange to show our appreciation to them. The gift consists of two YSS notebooks, two YSS postcards and stamps. I was really happy my buddy enjoyed the gift. Even though we were only at the school for a short period of time, I had a lot of fun there and I will always cherish this day in my memories."* ~ Keisha, 3E1

*"On the last day of our trip, we went to a cooking class to learn about the authentic meals of vietnam such as fried spring rolls, mango salad and grilled prawn with noodles. We also managed to try out a traditional Vietnamese dessert which was interesting. I found the experience really enjoyable as I never thought I would be able to have a chance in doing this. We also went to the Ho Chi Minh Fine Arts museum and took a look at interesting art forms such as oil painting and paintings of the past. overall, having a chance to be able to experience the authentic culture of vietnam as well as be able to appreciate the fine arts of Vietnam was certainly a memorable one." *~ Valerie 3E1

*"Today, for the last day of our trip to Vietnam, we attended the Hoa Tuc Cooking class, where we learned to prepare authentic, delicious, and culturally significant dishes, including crispy mango salad, spring rolls, and barbecue prawns. Through this experience, I learnt how to truly appreciate Vietnamese culture and their cusines. After the trip to the cooking class, we then proceeded to the Museum of fine arts, where we viewed both traditional Vietnamese crafts and some European crafts aswell. During the trip to the museum of fine arts, i was most struck by the different types of painting methods, for example oil and lacquer paintings. These paintings both displayed and showcased  a vivid description of the nations history and culture."* ~ Kaeden 3E3
