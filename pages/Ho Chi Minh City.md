*"Traveling without our family for the first time was both exhilarating and nerve-wrecking! Although the thought of being in a whole different country without them might be scary, this experience offers me a chance to build confidence and become independent. At the same time, it opens new doors to understanding knowledge of other cultures and new friendships too!"* 
~ Alisha (3N2)

*"Watching the water puppet show was a truly unique experience. The soothing music and the captivating folk stories immediately drew me in, despite the language barrier. The actors' expressive movements and the well-coordinated puppetry conveyed the narrative clearly. It was fascinating to know that the talented actors were hidden behind a massive tent, yet their skills brought the puppets to life. Originating from Northern Vietnam and traditionally performed in the North, the art has found its way to Ho Chi Minh City. I even attempted to manipulate a fish-shaped water puppet myself, which initially felt quite challenging, but once I got the hang of it, controlling the puppet and performing tricks became easier. Although we were not seated in the front rows, I couldn't stop myself from pretending to deflect the occasional water splashes created by the skilled puppet masters."* ~ Areef (3E1)

*"The most memorable part of today was going to the war remnants museum. Seeing the photos of what had happened to the civilians made me realise how important it is to speak up about war as well as remembering the sacrifices that were made, even in the context of Singapore."* ~ Cheyenne (3E4)

*One interesting thing I learnt from the coconut candy making is that Singapore and Vietnam are interconnected as in both countries fusion fruits can be found. In Vietnam, coconut is made into chewy candy. There are also  a variety of flavours and colours. This is very similar to coconut candies such as Hu Zhen Long candies. Instead of only coconut flavor, mangosteen and durian flavor candies are sold in Singapore.* ~ Natasha 3N2

*Being able to visit Mekong Delta and actually experience riding the boat and trying out the different tidbits like the coconut candy and the natural honey was undoubtedly a once-in-a-lifetime experience. I was able to enjoy the scenic beauty and at the same time appreciate the nature and food the Vietnamese eat. It also gave me exposure to different parts of the country and i really enjoyed the trip to Mekong Delta.* ~ Valerie 3E1
