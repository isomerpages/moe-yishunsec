*"While watching the volleyball match, I realised  the importance of resilience. Despite the setbacks the red shirt team faced, they still put on a strong fight to the very end. The team mates were all very supportive and cheered  each other on. This inspire me to never give up even when things do not go our way."* ~ Chee Cheng from 3E5

*"The volleyballers inspired me to not give up no matter what. Even though the red team was losing, they did not give up and tried their best to fight for a win. It resulted in the intense rallies we witnessed. They made me want to work harder and train more so I can rally like them in the future."*  ~ Joy Tay Loke Xin  from 2 Seek

*"Today, as it is only the second day, I initially thought that the students would not be talking much to each other and the students would keep to their own groups but today everyone was talking and befriending each other. That made me very proud of my school mates as it only took us a short while to start engaging with one another. I enjoyed doing the sky lanterns as we could wish  for what we wanted and could express it in a very fun way with our friends. I hope the next few days in Taiwan will be as fun as today. Thank you !"* ~ Elessa Angel Emily from 1 Care

*"Today was very enriching and fun. We went on a hike at Bitoujiao  and went to a waterfall at Shifen  and learned the history behind the waterfall. Despite  the steepness of the mountain, we were resilient and completed the hike.  We also wrote our wishes on a lantern and released it.  It was indeed a very enriching and enjoyable day."* ~ Jaysanth from 3E5

*"I find today’s  activities fun and entertaining because we got  to go hiking with our friends and teachers. Throughout  the hike,  i  made  my friendship stronger by talking and sharing with my friends  about the surroundings.  Throughout the bus ride,  we learnt  about the history and geography of Taiwan from our tour guide. During meals, we get sat with  our  friends and teachers and that  help  us  create a better friendships. The favourite thing about dinner is that we help each other take food, like we are a family."* ~ Zander Ong Kai Jian from 1 Seek

*"From this trip, I have learned many wonderful things about Taipei and it's culture. We had the opportunity to see many wonderful views. We had alot of fun spending time with our friends. Through this trip, I've learned that it's important to cooperate with my friends so that we can overcome obstacles along the way. I remembered  on the first day, we were all excited when the tour guide announced that we were heading to the restaurant as we were all exhausted from the day. Overall, this trip would definitely be memorable for me."*  ~ Rayden from 1 Seek

*"Today is already the 3rd day in Taiwan and I have been enjoying myself here as I started to talk to new people I have never talked to before. Today, we went to visit 桃源国中 and I really enjoyed myself there as the people there are very friendly. We learn how to play Diabolo  from the students.. After that fun activity, we joined their cooking lesson and made tea jelly and egg tart. It was a fun and interesting learning activity as I have never made tea jelly and egg tart before. I hope all of us have a great day today and we hope we can go visit them again if  we got the chance to."* ~ Charmaine Wong Yi En, 1 SEEK

*”I had really enjoyed my time in the school visit and meeting many new faces.I was very surprised to see the sheer effort taken to welcome our school to theirs. The  slides shown in the screen were filled with detail and many memes were added. Furthermore,I believe that they took a lot of time just to prepare this special occasion even when they have a competition in two days.I enjoyed the food as it was tasty and the students did a very good job preparing the croissants as it tasted good as well. The part I enjoyed the most was the diabolo session,it is mesmerising to see the skills of the students when they played the diabolo and performed huge stunts."*

*"I really appreciate the patience and kindness the students have us when they taught us diabolo.I developed my character as I did not get frustrated when the diabolo strings get caught up and tangled together constantly and patiently handled it. The baking session had went smoothly as well."*

*"My time in the Taoyuan junior high school is a certainly an unforgettable one.”* ~ Sharath S/O Muthukumaran from 1 Integrity

*”I am happy that I was able to learn a new skill , which was playing the diabolo from the taiwan students. While doing so I was able to make some friends and also was told more about the taiwan landmarks . When we visited the temple , I was able to learn more about buddhism and taoism practices and its history. I also learnt how to make a jelly and egg tart from the cooking lessons at the school.

“*We have  been in Taiwan together for 4 days , and during these 4 days i have really learned many things, i learn about the Taiwan culture and what the students in Taiwan are learning during lesson and how there school looks like. And i am also getting much closer to my friends and i know them better now, even those who i didn't get a chance to talk to or rather i don't even know them at first.

And i am also really thankful that they have put in so much effort to welcome us and to get along with us. They were very friendly and also very enthusiastic.

*”I feel that the school experience today at 弘道国中 was very fun and welcoming. The students at the school were very friendly and kind, allowing us to make friends with them quickly. The classroom experience was very knowledgeable as there were many new things I experienced in that class. The basketball match was very fun and intense as the score was very close at the end. This experience will certainly be an unforgettable one with many memories being created.”* ~ Bernon Tay, 3E5

*”Travelling  from Singapore to Taiwan taught me an incredible amount about cultural diversity and adaptation. I learned to embrace different customs, traditions, and ways of living, broadening my perspective on the world from the activities we had with the taiwan students. Engaging with Taiwanese students in their math lesson today, has allowed me to appreciate the differences of their culture and language, fostering a deeper understanding and respect for diversity. This experience enhanced my adaptability, communication skills, and taught me the value of open-mindedness in a global community. The other activities such as laser tag and memorial hall has also gave me both fun and interest in Taiwan's entertainment facilities and their history as well.”* ~ Chew Kok Rui from 1 Integrity

*”I feel that today was enriching and more interactive then the other days because we learn in depth  about the man who helped built taiwan and also the schools we visited were exciting and enjoyable. The part I most certainly enjoyed was the lazer tag game,  it was a once in a lifetime time experience as I have never went lazer tag before,thus I'm grateful for playing and being happy with my dear peers.”* ~ Hiresh s/o Rajasegaran from 1 Seek

“*Today we went to Taipei 101 and learnt some things from the tour guide that i did not know previously. For example, taiwan 101 has one of the fastest lifts in the world. After the tour at 101, we then went to 西們盯. At 西們町, we got the opportunity to buy bubble tea and other souvenirs  that we want to give our friends amd families. Before we left, we went to the photo booth to take some photos with my friends while wearing some accessories they provided to keep for memories. Today was one of my favourite days.”* ~ Liao Yixin 1 Respect

*“Today  is the last day, I thought that everybody was very excited to go back to Singapore but they were also equally sad to leave Taiwan as they had made many memories there. Even though we were unable to go to the museum as it was permanently closed, it was good that we still got the chance to taste the tea ourselves and spend time with our schoolmates and peers in the cable car. I was able to interact more with them in the cable car and used it as an opportunity to get to know them more.”* ~ Tan Kun Yang 1 Integrity
