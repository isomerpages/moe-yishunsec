*“While watching the volleyball match, I realised  the importance of resilience. Despite the setbacks the red team faced, they still put on a strong fight to the very end. The team mates were all very supportive and cheered  each other on. This inspired me to never give up even when things do not go our way.”* ~ Chee Cheng, 3E5

*“The volleyballers inspired me to not give up, no matter what. Even though the red team was losing, they did not give up and tried their best to fight for a win. It resulted in the intense rallies we witnessed. They made me want to work harder and train more so I can rally like them in the future.”* ~ Joy Tay Loke Xin , 2 Seek

*“As it is only the second day, I initially thought that the students would not be talking much to each other and the students would keep to their own groups, but today everyone was talking and befriending each other. That made me very proud of my school mates as it only took us a short while to start engaging with one another. I enjoyed doing the sky lanterns as we could wish  for what we wanted and could express it in a very fun way with our friends. I hope the next few days in Taiwan will be as fun as today. Thank you !”* ~ Elessa Angel Emily, 1 Care

*“Today was very enriching and fun. We went on a hike at Bitoujiao  and went to a waterfall at Shifen and learned the history behind the waterfall. Despite  the steepness of the mountain, we were resilient and completed the hike.  We also wrote our wishes on a lantern and released it.  It was indeed a very enriching and enjoyable day.”* ~ Jaysanth, 3E5

*“I find today’s  activities fun and entertaining because we got  to go hiking with our friends and teachers. Throughout  the hike,  I  made my friendship stronger by talking and sharing with my friends  about the surroundings.  Throughout the bus ride,  we learnt  about the history and geography of Taiwan from our tour guide. During meals, we sat with  our friends and teachers and that helped us create better friendships. My favourite thing about dinner is that we helped serve each other food, like we are a family.”* ~ Zander Ong Kai Jian, 1  Seek

*“From this trip, I have learned many wonderful things about Taipei and it's culture. We had the opportunity to see many wonderful views. We had a lot of fun spending time with our friends. Through this trip, I've learned that it's important to cooperate with my friends so that we can overcome obstacles along the way. I remembered  on the first day, we were all excited when the tour guide announced that we were heading to the restaurant as we were all exhausted from the day. Overall, this trip would definitely be memorable for me.”* ~ Rayden, 1 Seek

*“Today is already the 3rd day in Taiwan and I have been enjoying myself here as I started to talk to new people I have never spoken to before. Today, we went to visit 桃源国中 and I really enjoyed myself there as the people there are very friendly. We learnt to play the Diabolo from the students. After that fun activity, we joined their cooking lesson and made tea jelly and egg tarts. It was a fun and interesting learning activity as I have never made tea jelly and egg tarts before. I hope all of us had a great day today and we hope we can go visit them again if  we get the chance to.”* Charmaine Wong Yi En, 1 Seek

*“Today it is already the third day in Taiwan and i am already getting much more closer to some of my schoolmates, even those that i have never spoken to before. I like how all of us get along well with each other even though we just got to know about one another. I really enjoyed going to the school in Taiwan today because i got to experience different kind of things with the students there. I hope that all of us will have fun at the end of the day.”* ~ Darwisyah Ul'dah, 1 Soar

*“I really enjoyed my time at the school visit and meeting many new faces. I was very surprised to see the sheer amount of effort taken to welcome us to their school. The  slides shown on the screen were filled with detail and many memes were added.  Furthermore, I believe that they took a lot of time just to prepare for this special occasion, even when they had a competition in two days. I enjoyed the food as it was tasty and the students did a very good job preparing the croissants as it tasted good as well. The part I enjoyed the most was the diabolo session, it is mesmerising to see the skills of the students when they played the diabolo and performed huge stunts. 

I really appreciate the patience and kindness the students showed us when they taught us how to play the diabolo. I developed my character as I did not get frustrated when the diabolo strings got caught and tangled together constantly. The baking session also went smoothly as well.

My time in the Taoyuan junior high school is certainly an unforgettable one.”* ~ Sharath S/O Muthukumaran, 1 Integrity

*“I am happy that I was able to learn a new skill , which was playing the diabolo from the Taiwanese students. While doing so, I was able to make some friends and also learned more about Taiwan landmarks . When we visited the temple , I was able to learn more about Buddhist and Taoist practices and its history. I also learnt how to make a jelly and egg tart from the cooking lessons at the school. This is definitely an experience that I would never forget and I wish that I can do it again.”* ~ Tan  Hong  Rui, 3E5

*“We have  been in Taiwan together for 4 days , and during these 4 days, I have really learned many things, I learnt about the Taiwanese culture and what the students in Taiwan learn during lessons, and how their school looks like. And I also got much closer to my friends and got to know them better now, even those whom I didn't get a chance to talk to or rather I didn't even know at first. I love the way we got along together, I also feel very happy because we had a chance to visit the schools in Taiwan. And iI am also really thankful that they have put in so much effort to welcome us and to get along with us. They were very friendly and also very enthusiastic. I gOt to learn about their culture and experience how and what they learn during lesson time. I really like how they study and also the way that their teacher teaches them. I hope that we will still have chance to visit Taipei again.”* ~ Teo Rui Ling Charlene, 1 Seek

*“I feel that the school experience today at 弘道国中 was very fun and welcoming. The students at the school were very friendly and kind, allowing us to make friends with them quickly. The classroom experience was very enriching as there were many new things I experienced in that class. The basketball match was very fun and intense as the score was very close at the end. This experience will certainly be an unforgettable one with many memories being created.”* ~ Bernon Tay, 3E5

*“Travelling  from Singapore to Taiwan has taught me an incredible amount about cultural diversity and adaptation. I learned to embrace different customs, traditions, and ways of living, broadening my perspective on the world from the activities we had with the Taiwan students. Engaging with Taiwanese students in their math lesson today, allowed me to appreciate the differences in their culture and language, fostering a deeper understanding and respect for diversity. This experience enhanced my adaptability, communication skills, and taught me the value of open-mindedness in a global community. The other activities such as laser tag and visit to memorial was both fun and and increased my interest in Taiwan's history.”* ~ Chew Kok Rui, 1 Integrity

*“I feel that today was enriching and more interactive then the other days because we learned, in depth,  about the man who helped built Taiwan and also the because the schools we visited were exciting and enjoyable. The part I most certainly enjoyed was the lazer tag game,  it was a once in a lifetime time experience as I have never tried lazer tag before  Thus, I'm grateful for the opportunity to play and being happy with my dear peers.”* ~ Hiresh s/o Rajasegaran,  1 Seek

*“Today we went to Taipei 101 and learnt some things from the tour guide that I did not know previously. For example, Taiwan 101 has one of the fastest lifts in the world. After the tour at 101, we then went to 西們盯. At 西們町, we got the opportunity to buy bubble tea and other souvenirs  that we want to give our friends and families. Before we left, we went to the photo booth to take some photos with my friends while wearing some accessories they provided, to keep for memories. Today was one of my favourite days.”* ~ Liao Yixin, 1 Respect
