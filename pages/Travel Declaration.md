Travel Declaration for Mid-Year Holidays 2024
-------

Dear Parent/Guardian,

To ensure that schools continue to be a healthy and safe environment for all, we require parents/guardians to make a travel declaration for your child/ward if he/she will be travelling for the holidays.

We encourage you to do so via the **Parents’ Gateway (PG) app** (refer to [https://pg.moe.edu.sg](https://pg.moe.edu.sg)). To make a travel declaration for your child/ward via **Parents’ Gateway (PG) app**, go to **[SERVICE > DECLARE TRAVELS]**. 

* Please declare your child/ward’s travel plan(s), indicating both the country and city of travel, and any city of transit, by **24 May 2024** (the last day of the term). Only one parent is required to make the declaration.  
* Parents not in PG, please use the link below to submit your child/ward's travel declaration 

If your child/ward is **not travelling** during the holidays, **no action is required.**

When planning your travel, please refer to [https://www.ica.gov.sg/enter-transit-depart](https://www.ica.gov.sg/enter-transit-depart)for more information and updates. If there is a change in travel plan(s) after declaration, please submit a new travel declaration via PG or inform the school if the travel plan(s) are cancelled. 

Thank you for your partnership and support to keep our school safe.
