Travel Declaration for June 2023
-------

Dear Parent/Guardian,

To ensure that schools continue to be a healthy and safe environment for all, we require parents/guardians to make a travel declaration for your child/ward if he/she will be travelling for the holidays by **10 Mar 2023 (Friday)**.

We encourage you to do so via the **Parents’ Gateway (PG) app** (refer to [https://pg.moe.edu.sg](https://pg.moe.edu.sg)). To make a travel declaration for your child/ward via**Parents’ Gateway (PG) app**, go to **[SERVICE > DECLARE TRAVELS]**. 

* Parents not in PG, please use the link below to submit your child/ward's travel declaration

If your child/ward is travelling, please indicate clearly both the country and city of travel. Only one parent is required to make the declaration. 

If your child/ward is **not travelling** during the holidays, **no action is required.**

When planning your child/ward’s travel, please refer to[ https://www.ica.gov.sg/enter-transit-depart]( https://www.ica.gov.sg/enter-transit-depart) for more information and updates. If there is a change in travel plan(s) after declaration, please inform the school as soon as possible. 

Thank you for your partnership and support to keep our school safe.
