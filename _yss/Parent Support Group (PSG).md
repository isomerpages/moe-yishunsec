<h4>Mother’s Day Appreciation – ‘Sweet Gratitude’</h4>
<p>The school organised a Mother’s day Appreciation activity where students
made bouquets for their mothers and grandmothers to show their affection
and express their gratitude and appreciation to their mothers and grandmothers.
The Parent Support Group was pivotal in the success of the event guiding
students in the bouquet-making activity. Kudos to the parent volunteers
and the student participants.</p>
<h4>Feedback from parents</h4>
<p><em>It was very sweet to receive a Mother’s Day flower from my son! He is my pillar of support.</em>
</p>
<p>~ Mrs Jaya, Parent of Sec 2 student</p>
<p><em>My child was very proud and excited to see me volunteering in her school. She brought her friends over and introduced me to them. My child saw that I was interested and willing to support in her teenage journey and school life hence she is willing to let me stay involved in her current journey. This is truely a rewarding experience for both the parent and child.</em>
</p>
<p>~ Mrs Lydia Chua, Parent of Sec 1 student</p>
<h4>Feedback from students</h4>
<p><em>I was really excited making the bouquet. My mother was pleasantly surprised too. She said “Thank you my big baby”</em>
</p>
<p>~ Lecia, 3E5</p>
<p><em>I learnt a new skill. I think it is quite cool. Thank you to the parent volunteers who were very skillful and patient in teaching me how to make the bouquet. It was easy to make the bouquet and my mother liked it very much.</em>
</p>

<h4>Mother’s Day &amp; Father's Day Tribute – Folds of Love</h4>
<p>Our parent volunteers imparted skills of Towel Origami to students. Students
folded towels to create bears for their parents and grandparents as a token
of love, appreciation and gratitude. What a sweet gesture it was!</p>
