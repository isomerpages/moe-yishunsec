School Crest, Song, Creed & Motto
=================================
School Crest:
-------------
<img src="/images/school-crest1.png" style="width:30%">

Our School Crest is in the shape of a drop of water that symbolises the thirst for knowledge.


The branches represent our 3 core values that form the guiding principles to achieve the 3 desired outcomes for an Yishunite.


The progressive growth of the branches indicates the different stages of learning our pupils have to go through before achieving their ultimate goal.


The circle represents the fruits of labour that can be achieved through dedication, determination and self-discipline.

School Song:
------------

**Verse 1**

<center>
There’s a joyful spirit that we share
<br>In our home at Yishun Secondary School 
<br>You guide us onward with your love and care
<br>You light our way with each golden rule
</center>

**Chorus**

<center>
All that we can do we’ll do for you
<br>Let’ be the best that we can be at work and at play
<br>And we’ll always be proud of you
 <br>Dear, Yishun Secondary School
</center>
  

**Verse 2**

<center>
Your motto builds a strength of will
<br>Your precious teaching we will always keep
<br>With determination and in earnest zeal
<br>The fruits of our labour we will reap
</center>

As true Yishunites,

<br>No matter where we’re from.
<br>We pledge to uphold the values of our school,

<br>If it is to be, It is up to you and me.
