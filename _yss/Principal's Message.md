<p>Dear Parents, Students and Partners of Yishun Secondary School,</p>
<p>As we begin 2025, I would like to thank all parents, students and stakeholders
for working closely with us last year in providing quality education to
all Yishunites.</p>
<p>2024 has been a fruitful year as we explored partnerships and pursued
learning experiences both in Singapore and abroad, and continued to carry
out the many activities that make the Yishunite Experience engaging and
meaningful for our students.</p>
<p>In 2025, we have value-added to many of the programmes in school and come
up with new ones that will make learning more Exciting, Engaging and Enriching
for all Yishunites. To start, we will have 4 levels of Subject Based Banding
(SBB) and mixed form-classes for optimal social mixing amongst the students.
We are also happy to be able to ensure smaller class sizes for all subjects
at Upper Secondary Levels. The smaller class size will ensure more engaging
Teaching and Learning for our students.</p>
<p>We are also happy to continue to offer Yishunites with a wide range of
subjects at Upper Secondary Levels. The subjects offered include Pure Sciences,
Pure Humanities (Literature, Geography and History), Higher Mother-Tongue
Languages (Chinese, Malay, and Tamil Languages), and Additional Mathematics.
We also offer students the opportunity to choose electives that they might
be interested in. These electives include Exercise and Sports Science,
Design and Technology, Art, Food and Consumer Education, and Retail Operations.</p>
<p>We will continue with the&nbsp;<strong>YSS Learning Festival for Students</strong>&nbsp;after
positive feedback from parents and students. We will continue to take learning
beyond the classroom where students can experience for themselves what
they have learnt in the textbooks and put theory into practice in this
experiential learning venture.</p>
<p>2025 also sees the second year of the&nbsp;<strong>Cluster CCA initiative</strong>&nbsp;where
we have new and exciting CCAs added to the ones we currently have. Secondary
1 girls will be able to join the Football (Girls) CCA which will be hosted
by YSS. In addition, Secondary 1 students may also choose to join another
cluster CCA, Wushu, which is hosted by other school within the N2 cluster.</p>
<p><strong>Overseas learning journeys</strong>&nbsp;help broaden the minds
of our students, keep them rooted to Singapore while learning about foreign
cultures, and develop a sense of independence as they visit foreign destinations
with their peers. We will continue to provide opportunities for our students
to venture beyond the comfortable and familiar, and to move beyond seeing
the School as our World, to seeing the World as our School.</p>
<p>On the curriculum front, the staff and I have always prioritised a curriculum
that is Exciting, Engaging and Enriching for our students through building
our staff capacity and capabilities and strengthening our resources through
leveraging Educational Technology. The various departments will also be
embarking on more&nbsp;<strong>interdisciplinary projects</strong>&nbsp;that
will foster critical and creative thinking, collaboration and problem-solving
skills. This will allow students to see connections between different subjects,
making learning more engaging and relevant.</p>
<p>We will continue to provide a holistic education that strives to develop
our students as all-rounders and life-long learners who are equipped with
the intellectual capacity as well as the sound moral grounding necessary
for them to embrace the challenges in life.</p>
<p>I look forward to our journey together with our parents, our stakeholders,
my staff and our students in the coming year.</p>
<p>Best regards and wishing everyone a good year ahead!</p>
<p>Mrs Regina Lee
<br>Principal</p>
