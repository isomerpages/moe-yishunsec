<p>Dear Parents, Students and Partners of Yishun Secondary School</p>
<p>As we begin 2026, I would like to express my sincere appreciation to our
parents, students and partners for working closely with us in the past
year to provide a quality education for all Yishunites.</p>
<p>2025 was a fruitful year for the school as we strengthened meaningful
partnerships, expanded enriching learning experiences both locally and
overseas, and continued to carry out programmes and activities that make
the <strong>Yishunite Experience!</strong> engaging and purposeful for our
students.</p>
<p>On the curriculum front, my staff and I remain committed to delivering
an Exciting, Engaging and Enriching curriculum. We will continue to build
staff capacity, strengthen resources, leverage Educational Technology,
and deepen interdisciplinary learning to develop students’ critical and
creative thinking, collaboration, and problem-solving skills.</p>
<p>In 2026, we have further enhanced many of our existing programmes and
introduced new initiatives to make learning even more <strong><em>Exciting</em></strong>, <strong><em>Engaging</em></strong> and <strong><em>Enriching </em></strong>for
all Yishunites. We will continue to offer a wide range of subjects at the
Upper Secondary level, including the Sciences, Humanities (Literature and
Geography), Higher Mother Tongue Languages (Chinese, Malay and Tamil),
and Additional Mathematics. In addition, students may choose from a variety
of electives aligned to their interests, such as Exercise and Sports Science,
Design and Technology, Art, Food and Consumer Education, and Retail Operations.</p>
<p>Following positive feedback from parents and students, the <strong>YSS Learning Festival</strong> will
continue to take learning beyond the classroom through authentic and meaningful
experiential opportunities, where students apply concepts learnt and put
theory into practice. <strong>YSS Goes Global</strong> will also remain an
integral part of our programmes. These experiences broaden students’ perspectives,
nurture independence and confidence, and help them remain rooted in Singapore
while appreciating other cultures, as they embrace the belief that the
World is our School.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
