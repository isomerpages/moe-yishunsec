Principal's Message
===================

Dear Parents, Students and Partners of Yishun Secondary School

As we begin 2023, I would like to thank all parents, students and stakeholders for working closely with us last year in providing quality education to all Yishunites. 

I believe the synergy between the school and her partners has been a good one. We were able to stay focused on our goals and continue with providing meaningful learning experiences for our students.

2022 was a fruitful year as safety measurement measures were gradually relaxed.  We explored new grounds on the home-based learning front. We also reinstated many of the activities that make school life engaging and meaningful for our students. These included CCAs, national competitions, cohort camps and learning journeys. 

In 2023, as we move deeper into normalcy, we have value-added to many of the programmes in school and come up with new ones that will make learning more Exciting, Engaging and Enriching for all Yishunites. 

In Term Two of 2023, we look forward to the inaugural YSS Learning Festival for Students. The learning festival takes learning beyond the classroom where students can experience for themselves what they have learnt in the textbooks.  A total of 3 days have been set aside for this experiential learning venture for our students. 

With international borders being opened, we will organise overseas learning journeys for our students in 2023. Overseas learning journeys help broaden the minds of our students, keep them rooted to Singapore while learning about foreign cultures and, develop a sense of independence as they visit foreign destinations with their peers. 

On the curriculum front, I am happy to say that the staff and I have worked hard in customising a curriculum that is Exciting, Engaging and Enriching for our students. Facilities to support teaching and learning have also been refurbished or created to ensure that students benefit from state-of-the-art technology and, are able to learn in comfort.

We will continue to provide a holistic education that strives to develop our students as all-rounders who are equipped with the intellectual capacity as well as the sound moral grounding necessary for them to embrace the challenges in life. 

We are excited in 2023 as we implement Full Subject-Based Banding (FSBB) for both Secondary One and Two classes. FSBB allows for our students to study subjects at a level that best suits their learning abilities. FSBB also allows for students to interact and integrate better with their peers.

I look forward to our journey together with our parents, our stakeholders, my staff and our students in the coming year.

Best regards and wishing everyone a good year ahead!

Mrs Regina Lee
