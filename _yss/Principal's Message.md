Principal's Message
===================

Dear Parents, Students and Partners of Yishun Secondary School

  

As we begin 2022. I would like to thank all parents, students and stakeholders for working closely with us last year in providing quality education to our students. 

  

I believe the synergy between the school and her partners has been a good one. We were able to stay focused on our goals and continue with providing meaningful learning experiences for our students.

  

The last year has been a fruitful one. We explored new grounds on the home-based learning front. We explored new ways of doing things which we long took for granted. Meetings and school events continued but on new platforms. We were able to communicate effectively and efficiently despite social distancing measures.

  

On the curriculum front, I am happy to say that the staff and I have worked hard in customizing a curriculum that is engaging and enriching for our students. Facilities to support teaching and learning have also been refurbished or created to ensure that students benefit from state of the art technology and, are able to learn in comfort.

  

We will continue to provide a holistic education that strives to develop our students as all-rounders who are equipped with the intellectual capacity as well as the sound moral grounding necessary for them to embrace the challenges in life. 

  

We are excited in 2022 as we implement the Full Subject-Based Banding (FSBB) for our Secondary One classes. FSBB allows for our students to study subjects at a level that best suits their learning abilities. FSBB also allows for students to interact and integrate better with their peers. 

  

Along with providing meaningful learning experiences, the safety of our students during these times remain paramount. Do rest assured that the school will continue to be vigilant in enforcing safe management measures at all times so that our students will be able to enjoy the learning in a safe environment.

  

I look forward to our journey together with our parents, our stakeholders, my staff and our students in the coming year.

  

Stay Safe and Keep Well!

  

Mrs Regina Lee
