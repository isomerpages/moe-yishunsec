### Goal(s)

The Yishun Secondary School Student Development Team oversees the design and delivery of a holistic learning experience that all students undergo throughout their 4/5 years of education in Yishun Secondary School.

Its key role is to enhance the quality of school experience for Yishunites, with emphasis on values education (Respect, Resilience and Integrity) as its core, through the development of students’ academic and socio-emotional competencies to achieve the desired outcome of all Yishunites (Thinker, Innovator, Contributor).

It begins with Yishunites undergoing the important transitional phase from a primary school environment to a secondary school environment in the first year, with a structured progression to character and citizenship education, leadership development, Career Guidance and post-secondary education.


### STRUCTURE OF THE YISHUN SECONDARY SCHOOL STUDENT DEVELOPMENT TEAM

The School Principal oversees the whole Student Development Team. The Lower Secondary and Upper Secondary sections are in turn led by the two Vice-Principals.

Each of the levels consists of (i) one year head (ii) one level discipline master and (iii) one school counsellor, who look after character development as well as provide the socio-emotional support for their respective students.

The Student Development Team is also supported by the CCE Team (led by HOD CCE, SH CCE, ECG Coordinator & Student Manager), HOD Discipline as well as the Senior School Counsellor via their respective programmes, which are aligned to the overall Student Development Team framework.
