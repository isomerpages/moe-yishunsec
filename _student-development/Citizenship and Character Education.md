### Highlights / Achievements

A wide array of learning platforms and experiences are brought to our students to collectively build our students’ character and citizenship. Our department provides opportunities for our students to transfer their learning and to put good values and skills into action. This facilitates the internalisation of good values and skills which are critical to character and citizenship development. The key highlights for the year include:

* <b>Stronger Together Activities:</b> The myriad of activities which rallied Yishunites to pay tribute to frontliners, Foreign workers and many more. Students showed their appreciation and support to one another by preparing Care Packages, notes and videos of appreciation pledging to stand together during a challenging phase this year.
* <b>Care & Support programmes for students:</b> Our students were involved in projects that spread kindness and support to one another. Our Singapore Kindness Movement Ambassadors led these projects and brought much warmth to the school population.

Our school also received the following awards:

* <b>North-West CDC Partners Award (Silver)</b> in recognition of our school’s efforts in serving the community
* <b>Singapore Kindness Movement Award 2019 </b>– Certificate of Participation (11 Years)

#### Racial Harmony Day (RHD) Celebration 2022

The celebration aims to foster respect and appreciation to the customs and traditions of the different races and religions to coexist harmoniously.

The school commemorated RHD on 21 July 2022. The theme is ‘Singapore: Our Multicultural Mosaic’.  
Students were engaged in a skit entitled “Perfect Harmony’ during assembly. The skit depicts uniqueness of each individual and value of staying connected as a united community. First segment showed how the passion of two musicians, traditional kompang player and contemporary hip-hop rapper connects them together. Second segment was done in masks reflected how black cats are considered ‘superstitiously dangerous. 

During CCE period, students constructed digital photo collages to depict their views of Singapore as a multicultural mosaic. The activity acts as a common space for students with different backgrounds to forge a greater bonding. Prior to this, students explored places of worship, hawker centers etc. to take photos that reflect multicultural community in the aspects of lifestyle, food, architecture. 

Teachers engaged students to address ‘racism’ which may occur in schools, public spaces and online platforms. Through facilitation of authentic sharing of personal experiences shown in the case studies, students were able to think from different perspectives and look beyond racial markers. 

As part of the celebration, three types of childhood snacks were catered. They are eyeglass candy, dried fish fillet and muruku ikan snack. While it brings back memories of their school and neighbourhood, the shared connections among multicultural communities would be something for students to reminisce about.
