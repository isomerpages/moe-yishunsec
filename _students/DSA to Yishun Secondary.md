<h4>General Information about Direct School Admission (Secondary) for Admission in 2026</h4>
<p>The Direct School Admission-Secondary (DSA-Sec) scheme provides students
with the opportunity to seek admission to a secondary school, based on

the student’s aptitudes and strengths, bearing in mind the school’s academic

the area of talent.</p>
