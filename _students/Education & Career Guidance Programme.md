#### Education and Career Guidance – Work Exposure & Experience Programme 

In line with the national movement of SkillsFuture, the school organised the  Work Exposure & Experience programme for our Secondary 3 students. During the programme, the students are exposed to real work environments where they can discover their passion, learn about specific industries and how the workplace deals with challenges whilst developing their interpersonal and communication skills.

During the June holidays, 25 Sec 3 and Sec 4 students participated in a 3 to 5-day Work Exposure & Experience Programme at 5 organisations. 

The students found the programme useful in gaining first-hand knowledge on the industry, career opportunities and related work skills/ work values. 


#### Reflections from student

“At the office, I really had to go out of my comfort zone and learn the administrative duties. I had to be independent in the assigned task. I learnt that other than going to court, lawyers had to focus on a lot of administrative duties. It was indeed a steep learning curve these 5 days for me, learning new phrases, digesting a lot of information that was necessary for preparing for court hearings but I enjoyed the learning so much”  ~ Nur Shafiqah, 3N2 (Attached to Tembusu Law)

“Some of the assigned task were very tedious such as cutting resources. But, I loved the classroom experience. It was really fun. We had to help out with various activities for the children.” ~ Ramesh Marimuthu Dharshini, 3E4 (Attached to Julia Gabriels Centre)

“I learnt that besides being patient when preparing resources for the children, pre-school teachers need to be creative in designing resources and activities for the children” ~ Emily Loh, 3E1 (Attached to Julia Gabriels Centre)

“I wish to go back to Superpets during my holidays for a part-time job. I actually asked the boss if I can go back to help them out again. I enjoyed interacting with customers, helping them to assemble the pet accessories they purchased” ~  Marcus 3E1 (Attached to Superpets)
