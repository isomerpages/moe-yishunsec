### Objective

YSS Inspired! is a Student-Initiated Learning (SIL) programme offered in YSS. It forms part of the school’s effort to nurture self-directed learning and intrinsic motivation in our students. This is in line with MOE’s initiative to enable students to explore their interests and passions, and learn within and beyond the curriculum. This programme, formerly known as “Beyond Our Classrooms” was piloted in YSS in 2021 for secondary one students. It will be offered to all Secondary 1 and 2 students in 2022.

### Approach

YSS Inspired! programme is incorporated in the HBL timetable for all lower secondary classes. These sessions will comprised of a combination of zoom, pre-recorded lessons as well as reading materials for self-directed learning. At the end of every session, students will do a reflection of what they have learned in the SLS. Although the time table allocates 40 minutes for SIL, students are encouraged to go beyond the time allocated to deepen their knowledge in the respective areas of interest. 

At the end of module 1 and 2, students get to showcase what they have learned during a “Project Presentation Day”. The artefacts produced by the students will also be displayed on the school website.

### Synopsis of the Modules

YSS Inspired! programme consists of two modules that are designed to provide a unique experience for Yishunites. In the first module which will be carried out in Semester 1, the pursuit of students’ passion is integrated with the school’s Distinctive programmes.  Thus, the focus in this module would be to excite the students and deepen their knowledge on various activities related to the school’s niche of Music, Media and Technology. 

Module 2 will be carried out in Term 3. In this module, the Secondary 1 students will also be encouraged to pursue interests in areas related to the language, culture and customs of the countries in Asia to deepen their understanding of our regional neighbours and our connections to them. This is in line with MOE’s thrust to prepare our students to engage with Asia, in particular the ASEAN region. The Secondary 2 students will get to pursue interest in an area of their choice and propose a “Values-in-action” project that is related to their area of interest.
