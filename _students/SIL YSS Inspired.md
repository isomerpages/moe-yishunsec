<h2>Student-Initiated Learning (SIL)</h2>
<h3>Objective</h3>
<p>Implemented nationwide in 2021, Student-Initiated Learning (SIL) is a
component of Home-Based Learning days where time is set aside for students
to pursue their own interests and learn beyond their textbooks. In Yishun
Secondary School, students are introduced to SIL modules that are aligned
to our Distinctive Programmes.</p>
<h3>Structure</h3>
<p>In the first three sessions of HBL, students will acquire new skills aligned
to the Applied Learning Programme based on their interests. Students are
introduced to different SIL modules, such as learning different languages
and dialects like Malay, Mandarin, Tamil, Hokkien, Teochew, French, Japanese
and Korean. They are also exposed to other forms of art, such as magic
tricks and dance. Videos and reading materials are provided to the students
via SLS for self-directed learning.</p>
<p>In the subsequent three sessions, students will come up with a product
to showcase their learning. This can be in the form of digital drawings
and creating videos that capture their interests, such as football juggling,
dancing, playing instruments and A Day in the Life Of, amongst other things.</p>
