During your child’s developmental years, you may from time-to-time encounter parenting challenges, from disobedience to temper tantrums. Some of these challenges may intensify over time, particularly when children reach their teens.

  

To support you in your journey towards building a confident and resilient child, and strengthening your parent-child relationship, Yishun Secondary School has partnered with the Ministry of Social &amp; Family Development on the Positive Parenting Programme (Triple P). As part of the programme, online seminars are conducted to equip parents with knowledge and skills in managing children’s behavior during their teens.
