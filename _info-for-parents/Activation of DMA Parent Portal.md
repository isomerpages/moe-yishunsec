Dear Parent/Guardian,

As communicated earlier, your child’s/ward’s Personal Learning Device (PLD) has been installed with a DMA to ensure that he/she uses the PLD for learning in a safer digital learning environment.

For parents who have selected the Default and Option A, the DMA Parent Portal will be made available from 01 Nov 2021 to allow you to monitor your child’s/ward’s PLD activities.

You will receive an activation e-mail via the e-mail address that you have provided to the school. If the activation e-mail is not found in your Inbox, please check the ‘Junk Folder’ or ‘Spam Folder’ for the e-mail notification.

Please refer to the DMA Parent Guide attached for details on how to set up your account and use the Parent Portal.

For parents who have selected Option B, you will be able to disable the DMA for your child’s/ward’s PLD during the school-prescribed after-school hours on school days, and on weekends.

Should you encounter technical issues with the DMA or wish to share with us any feedback on the DMA, please contact the school at [yishun_ss@moe.edu.sg](mailto:yishun_ss@moe.edu.sg).

Thank you.
