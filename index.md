          announcement: The school announced HBL on 11 Jul for Sec 1-3 students due to
            urgent repairs in some of our classrooms. The contractors updated
            that they required extra time for safety checks. Thus, the school is
            extending HBL for Sec 1-3 students on 12 Jul. Sec 4&5 students
            report to school as per normal.
