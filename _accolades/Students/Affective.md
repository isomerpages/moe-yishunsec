<p><strong>Artwork Title:</strong> Rich in biodiversity: right in the heart
of the island, Singapore
<br><strong>Medium:</strong> Mixed Media (Colour Pencil, Pencil &amp; Gouache
Paint)</p>
<p><strong>Artist Statement:</strong> 
<br>Singapore calls itself ‘Garden City’. With landscape of towering architecture
in the compact city-state, Singapore has interspersed parks, rivers, and
ponds amid our high-rises. Visioning my organs as my friend, it would be
breathtaking to go on an adventure together and capture the island’s undeniable
charm. Depicting the anatomy of the human body as an illustration of the
iconic places and activities to discover in regions of Singapore. It is
also to raise awareness for the organs that can be donated and transplanted
to patients with end stage organ failure or for research and education
purposes. The first stop of the adventure is uncovering bird paradise at
Singapore’s Bird Park, and its nature wildlife reserve. It symbolises the
lungs, and below it is HDB flats, where many calls it ‘Home’, a sense of
belonging. Moving to the right, with a walk through the scenic view of
the Marina Bay and iconic statue, Merlion Park, representing the liver.
While travelling to the stomach of Singapore’s famous island, Sentosa,
and taking public transport in the MRT train to span around this rich biodiversity
Singapore, right in the heart of the island.</p>

<p><strong>Artwork Title:</strong> HEARTfelt Connections
<br><strong>Medium:</strong> Mixed Media (Colour Pencil, Pencil &amp; Gouache
Paint)</p>
<p><strong>Artist Statement:</strong> 
<br>Did you know that up to eight lives can be saved from organ donation?
For someone awaiting a transplant, donation can mean the difference between
life and death. From the mirror image of a broken vase heart on the left,
projecting the past, to the colourful and vibrant transformed heart on
the right, symbolising the future. With the bag of blood used for transfusion
dripped on, the ‘now’ attempts to knit and fix the broken self, while seeking
out by painting and imagining its future self. Donation of organs give
them hope for a second chance. For donor families, they can find solace
in knowledge of their loved one’s lifesaving legacy.</p>

<p><strong>North West Outstanding School Partner Award (SPA) 2021</strong>&nbsp;We
are pleased to share that our school has achieved the Gold for North West
Outstanding School Partner Award (SPA) 2021! The award is given to schools
that had participated actively in North West CDC programmes in 2020. Our
students, under the careful guidance of teachers, have shown acts of empathy
and resilience to care for the vulnerable and less fortunate in the community,
in their own little ways amid the unprecedented Covid-19 situation. We
would like to take this opportunity to thank all teachers who have contributed
their hard work and ‘heart’ work in guiding the students, while making
every experience we have at school count! Let us continue to affirm the
effort of our students in promoting a sustainable environment for all in
the long run. Thank you!</p>

<p><strong>Caring Heart@YSS</strong>&nbsp;While some of us were driven to
boredom during the Circuit Breaker, Wong Le Yi, Grace from 2E1 seized the
opportunity to do her part for the community by joining the Masks Sewn
With Love Project. Inspired by her Form Teachers’ daily bite-sized sharing
on the community needs and concerns amid Covid-19 crisis in Singapore,
Grace joined her mother to help the community to sew masks for those in
need. Grace’s family rallied together to make it a whole-family effort.
Her father brought out his wife’s sewing machine which had been stored
away for many years. Her mother took out her prized pair of tailoring scissors
for cutting the materials.Each day, Grace got up as early as 6:00am so
that she was able to undergo sewing tutorials from her mother before Home-Based
Learning lessons started at 8:00am. Her mother taught and supervised her
to master the cutting and machining the masks. Grace had to learn from
scratch the art of handling the scissors for cutting the material for the
masks, threading through the needle, running the thread into the bobbin
case, controlling the machine for straight and curved stitches and joining
the pieces of materials together. After a week of her first lesson, Grace
finally made her first mask, complete with a lining for it.Despite being
hit by hurdles themselves during the Covid-19 crisis, the family stayed
resilient and found time to spread love selflessly through their act of
kindness. Their big hearts would certainly go a long way in supporting
those in need.YSS shares Grace’s pride and love for the community. Grace
is a true inspiration to others of her age. Grace’s name is so apt for
the gracious deed she has undertaken.</p>
<p><strong><em>From Dawn to Dusk… A reflection from Grace</em></strong>&nbsp;It
was a slow start where I had to first learn how to do something as simple
as learning to thread into the needle followed by learning how the sewing
machine worked and the many steps to making a mask. In the beginning, I
made a lot of mistakes such as sewing stitches too far or too close to
the edge. Many times I had to pluck out the thread and redo it. It was
frustrating at first and there were times where I felt like giving up.
However, I was very determined to help the community and persevered. I
must thank my mother who kept motivating and guiding me through this journey.
In the end, it was worth all the pain and effort. I experienced a deep
sense of achievement, feeling of joy and excitement when I saw the finished
product of the first mask that I made. Soon, I made the first batch of
masks together with my mother and delivered them. I not only learned a
new skill during this period but also learnt how to balance making masks
and my study time. Making mask has now become a worthy hobby, a totally
new experience that I will never forget. I am looking forward to trying
out new things, learning new skills which I can use to help others.</p>
