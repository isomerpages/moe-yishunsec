Thank you for providing me with a lot of opportunities to develop myself as a positive person! In addition, I am very thankful to have made some true friends.”</em>

<p><em>“Yishun Sec school was where I began to have my taste of sweet successes. The support that I got built my character, turning me from a negative teenager who is often angry, to a positive person. The quote that comes to my mind when I think about Yishun sec is “Life is like a photography, we develop from the Negatives.”</em>
</p>
<p><em>“The teachers in the school did not give up on me and often encourage me on. I used to fail a lot when I was in lower secondary, but teachers spurred me on. So I learnt to step up and slowly through their guidance and patience, they developed me to who I am today. I still keep contacts with many of the students and staff of Yishun Sec as I would always be grateful for what they have done for me.”</em>

<h4>Salmah Sng Mei Wen</h4>

<li>
<p>Year 1 Student, Anderson Junior College</p>

<p>Currently a Student Council in AJC</p>

<li>
<p>YSS – 8 points for 2017 GCE O-Level Exam</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>“I remember stepping into YSS as a Secondary 1 student with non-existent self-esteem, with the only beliefs I had of myself being that I wouldn’t go far in life and that I wasn’t capable of doing anything good enough. I thought that I would just drift through everything, get average results, take on no significant roles and didn’t have any particular wants for myself. I had internalised the idea that I didn’t deserve anything nor would I mean anything to anyone.”</em>
</p>
<p><em>“But YSS changed that for me. My academic performance exceeded my imagination. I became Vice-Chairperson of my CCA (St John Brigade Singapore), a prefectorial board team leader, and received so many opportunities to involve myself in, like internationalisation trips, public duties and competitions. The teachers are all caring. Not only were they amazing at teaching, they had so much faith in me even though I didn’t believe in myself. They are really dedicated in their work. I honestly could not have made it this far without their unrelenting love, guidance and belief in me.”</em>
</p>
<p><em>“If you told the me back then how much I would gain in YSS in the four years , I only would have thought you were joking. Well, I’m not joking now when I say that YSS was one of the best decisions I’ve ever made. I’m so thankful to YSS and I wish everyone greater success!”</em>
