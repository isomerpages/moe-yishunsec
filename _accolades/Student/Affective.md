**North West Outstanding School Partner Award (SPA) 2021**&nbsp;We are pleased to share that our school has achieved the Gold for North West Outstanding School Partner Award (SPA) 2021! The award is given to schools that had participated actively in North West CDC programmes in 2020. Our students, under the careful guidance of teachers, have shown acts of empathy and resilience to care for the vulnerable and less fortunate in the community, in their own little ways amid the unprecedented Covid-19 situation. We would like to take this opportunity to thank all teachers who have contributed their hard work and ‘heart’ work in guiding the students, while making every experience we have at school count! Let us continue to affirm the effort of our students in promoting a sustainable environment for all in the long run. Thank you!

**Caring Heart@YSS**&nbsp;While some of us were driven to boredom during the Circuit Breaker, Wong Le Yi, Grace from 2E1 seized the opportunity to do her part for the community by joining the Masks Sewn With Love Project. Inspired by her Form Teachers’ daily bite-sized sharing on the community needs and concerns amid Covid-19 crisis in Singapore, Grace joined her mother to help the community to sew masks for those in need. Grace’s family rallied together to make it a whole-family effort. Her father brought out his wife’s sewing machine which had been stored away for many years. Her mother took out her prized pair of tailoring scissors for cutting the materials.Each day, Grace got up as early as 6:00am so that she was able to undergo sewing tutorials from her mother before Home-Based Learning lessons started at 8:00am. Her mother taught and supervised her to master the cutting and machining the masks. Grace had to learn from scratch the art of handling the scissors for cutting the material for the masks, threading through the needle, running the thread into the bobbin case, controlling the machine for straight and curved stitches and joining the pieces of materials together. After a week of her first lesson, Grace finally made her first mask, complete with a lining for it.Despite being hit by hurdles themselves during the Covid-19 crisis, the family stayed resilient and found time to spread love selflessly through their act of kindness. Their big hearts would certainly go a long way in supporting those in need.YSS shares Grace’s pride and love for the community. Grace is a true inspiration to others of her age. Grace’s name is so apt for the gracious deed she has undertaken.

  

**_From Dawn to Dusk… A reflection from Grace_**&nbsp;It was a slow start where I had to first learn how to do something as simple as learning to thread into the needle followed by learning how the sewing machine worked and the many steps to making a mask. In the beginning, I made a lot of mistakes such as sewing stitches too far or too close to the edge. Many times I had to pluck out the thread and redo it. It was frustrating at first and there were times where I felt like giving up. However, I was very determined to help the community and persevered. I must thank my mother who kept motivating and guiding me through this journey. In the end, it was worth all the pain and effort. I experienced a deep sense of achievement, feeling of joy and excitement when I saw the finished product of the first mask that I made. Soon, I made the first batch of masks together with my mother and delivered them. I not only learned a new skill during this period but also learnt how to balance making masks and my study time. Making mask has now become a worthy hobby, a totally new experience that I will never forget. I am looking forward to trying out new things, learning new skills which I can use to help others.
