**Naanum oru Padaippali – Budding Writers**

The Tamil Language Unit of the Mother Tongue Languages Branch, Curriculum Planning and Development Division 1 has been organising the Budding Writers’ and Artistes’ Programme in Tamil Language for Secondary school students annually.  This year’s programme was conducted by TLU as a series of 3 online workshops. These workshops provided the students the opportunity to hone their literary and artistic skills and appreciation. Students had to first attend two workshops and submit their short stories at the end of the second workshop. Only the best 20 were given the opportunity to attend the third workshop. Our students who were selected for the third workshop participated in the final round of the story writing competition and among them two of our Yishunites were awarded trophies and certificates. This year **AISHWARYAAGNANAM IYAPPAN of 2E3** and **VINODA D/O RAVICHANDRAN of 3E1** has done us proud by winning the ‘Budding Writers’ award in the Lower secondary and Upper secondary categories respectively.
