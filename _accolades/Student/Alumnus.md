YSS has taught me over the 4 years. My life back then was like that of
a rollercoaster. But at the same time, my teachers were always there
with me through it all, checking up on me and believing in me. I will
always remember their care and concern. Thank you for providing me
with a lot of opportunities to develop myself as a positive person! In
addition, I am very thankful to have made some true friends.”*

in YSS. Those four years have instilled in me the values of discipline
and diligence, and my teachers have shown me what a joy learning can
be. I am thankful for the sense of self-belief that I have gained through
the teachers and B.E. Project.”*

#### Yoh Kai Xiang




* Currently Year 1student of Ngee Ann poly (FILM, SOUND, and Video)
* Graduated from YSS in 2015

Recipient of :

* Tay Eng Soon Scholarship
* Outstanding student Award (Nitec in Digital Audio and Video Production)
* Service Star Award 2017 (DIAMOND) from ITE College West
* GOLD Couse Medal award for Outstanding Performance in ITE

*“Yishun Sec school was where I began to have my taste of sweet
successes. The support that I got built my character, turning me from
a negative teenager who is often angry, to a positive person. The quote
that comes to my mind when I think about Yishun sec is “Life is like a
photography, we develop from the Negatives.”*


*“The teachers in the school did not give up on me and often encourage
me on. I used to fail a lot when I was in lower secondary, but teachers
spurred me on. So I learnt to step up and slowly through their guidance
and patience, they developed me to who I am today. I still keep contacts
with many of the students and staff of Yishun Sec as I would always be
grateful for what they have done for me.”*

#### Salmah Sng Mei Wen



* Year 1 Student, Anderson Junior College
* Currently a Student Council in AJC
* YSS – 8 points for 2017 GCE O-Level Exam

*“I remember stepping into YSS as a Secondary 1 student with
non-existent self-esteem, with the only beliefs I had of myself being
that I wouldn’t go far in life and that I wasn’t capable of doing
anything good enough. I thought that I would just drift through
everything, get average results, take on no significant roles and
didn’t have any particular wants for myself. I had internalised the
idea that I didn’t deserve anything nor would I mean anything to anyone.”*


*“But YSS changed that for me. My academic performance exceeded
my imagination. I became Vice-Chairperson of my CCA
(St John Brigade Singapore), a prefectorial board team leader, and received
so many opportunities to involve myself in, like internationalisation trips,
public duties and competitions. The teachers are all caring.
Not only were they amazing at teaching, they had so much faith in me
even though I didn’t believe in myself. They are really dedicated in
their work. I honestly could not have made it this far without their
unrelenting love, guidance and belief in me.”*


*“If you told the me back then how much I would gain in YSS in the
four years , I only would have thought you were joking.
Well, I’m not joking now when I say that YSS was one of the best
decisions I’ve ever made. I’m so thankful to YSS and I wish everyone
greater success!”*
