<h3>Staff Professional Development</h3>
<p>Students face increasing uncertainties and anxieties due to COVID-19,
technological disruptions, and geopolitical challenges. The Future of Learning,
a movement to transform what and how our students learn, is thus necessary
for our students to thrive and harness opportunities of our rapidly changing
world.</p>
<p>As teachers lie at the heart of any educational change, the success of
the Future of Learning relies largely on future-ready teachers. To prepare
future-ready students, teachers’ roles – Role Model, Designer and Facilitator
of Learning, Student Mentor, and Lifelong Learner – have been refreshed.
Teachers will need to be equipped with the relevant skills to perform these
refreshed roles competently.</p>
<p>In Yishun Secondary, professional learning has been geared towards raising
the knowledge, competencies, and dispositions of future-ready teachers.
Professional learning comprises the six SkillsFuture for Educators areas
of practice such as Assessment Literacy, e-Pedagogy, Differentiated Instructions,
Inquiry-based Learning, Support for Students with Special Educational Needs,
Character and Citizenship Education. These areas of practice help our teachers
improve their practice, impact student outcomes, and thrive in a dynamic
education landscape.</p>
<p>Some professional learning activities organised by the school:</p>
