<p>The article features ND celebration of 2 schools, namely Kranji Pri, and
Yishun Sec. For Kranji Pri, their students took part in the Stagmont Park
CC ND Decoration Competition, where they made use of recycled materials
to replicate five-foot way models, a unqiue architectural feature of Singapore.
For Yishun Sec, the article talks about our morning Observance Ceremony
and its significance, as well as our virtual celebration, which includes
an ND dance, art &amp; craft (ND fan making), as well as the Student Leaders’
skit. As we have incorporated elements of art, drama and dance into the
celebration, Mr Tay, the VP, explained that this is in line with our school’s
Distinctive Programmes (Sonic Arts &amp; Communiy Service through the Arts).
It is hoped that through such avenues, the school community can find relief
from stress, especially in the light of the current pandemic. Liu Yingxuan,
Sec 2E2, who played the role of a kampong nanny in the skit, shared her
reflections on participating in the entire process of the skit production,
from script-writing and casting, to rehearsals and filming. In this journey,
she is reminded of the importance of mutual respect in our multi-racial
society.</p>

<p><strong>Yishun Secondary School Explores Possibility of Digital Overseas Immersion Programme to Allow Students to Carry on with Their Cross-cultural Learning</strong>
</p>
<p>Yishun Secondary School is committed to providing students with cross-cultural
learning opportunities through its Yishun Goes Global Programme. The school’s
overseas immersion programme was expanded to five countries and regions
last year, namely Indonesia, China, Taiwan, Thailand and Cambodia.</p>
<p>Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Yishun Secondary School is exploring the
possibility of using online platforms for its overseas immersion programme
so that students can continue to communicate with their overseas counterparts
despite the global pandemic and not lose out on the learning that these
partnerships bring.</p>
<p>The Yishun Goes Global Programme takes on a 3-pronged approach; the pre-departure
programme, the actual overseas learning journey and the post-trip programme.
At the interview Mr Tay Hiang Soon Vice-Principal, Yishun Secondary School,
shared that teachers would discuss with the students the learning goals
to be achieved before the students embark on their overseas learning journey.
Students are also tasked to research for information regarding their partner
school, the unique characteristics of the countries they were visiting
and, how they can better communicate with the locals.</p>
<p>Before departure, students also interact with their peers from partner
schools via video conference. Mr Tay said that this prior interaction facilitates
the friendship forged between the two groups of students. During these
“conversations” students start their collaboration on learning projected
or performances to deepen cross-cultural learning.</p>
<p>Upon return, students will share their learning experiences with their
schoolmates.</p>
<p>However, in view of the current global pandemic, the school the school
had to suspend its overseas immersion programme. Mr Tay commented that
the school is having a discussion with its partner schools to explore the
possibility of having a “digital immersion programme” which will include
getting students to film short videos to introduce local attractions or
special things about the school to their foreign counterparts.</p>
<p>Secondary 3 student Elaine Wee Lok Yi went to Shanghai with her classmates
at the end of last year on a 5-day cultural immersion programme. She said
that this was the first time she travelled abroad without the company of
her family members. It not only taught her to be independent, but also
helped her to become more adaptable. She added, “When communicating with
the local students, I would ask friends to help translate when I encountered
language barrier. In the process, I also learnt a lot of special terms
used by the locals.”</p>
