Theme: **Stronger Together, Majulah!**
<br>Date: 8 August 2022 (Monday)
<br>Time: 07:35 am – 10:30 am

The National Day celebration returns in full swing to the parade square and hall this year. Centered around the theme ‘Stronger Together, Majulah!’, the commemoration encapsulates our hopes and spirit as a nation since our independence 57 years ago. It is a call for Singaporeans to strive for a better future and grow from strength to strength as we emerge from COVID-19.

Our school’s SAC Chairperson, Mr Andrew Foong and SAC Vice-Chairperson, Mdm Penny Ang were the invited guests for the celebration. The celebration started in the morning on Monday 8 August when our Uniform Groups cadets kick-started the observance ceremony at the parade square. The parade was led by the National Cadet Corps together with contingents from the other Uniformed Groups. This was followed by the singing of the national anthem and reciting of the pledge. After which, Mr Tay, our Vice-Principal, delivered the National Day message to the school. The segment ended on a high note with recitation of the ‘Recollections’ which reminded us of the challenges overcame by Singapore as a young nation.

Next, students immersed themselves in a craft activity in the classrooms to create coasters from red and white Perler beads. Students are reminded of the values of unity and equality of all races represented by the colours of the Singapore flag.
