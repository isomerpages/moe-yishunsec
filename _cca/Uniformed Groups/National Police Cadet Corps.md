### Student’s Quotes

	
*“Overall, NPCC has been an enriching experience where I was able to learn valuable leadership skills. Through the lows, I have learnt on how to communicate with my squadmates. Through the highs, I have learnt to cherish the hard work that we have put in and really get to bond with my squadmates. Although the trainings were tiring and sometimes frustrating, the negative feelings seem to go away instantly the next day."*

<div style="text-align:right;">~Mohammad Danish Aiman, FieId Instructor and Head Of Logistics</div>


*“It has been an exhilarating experience being in the Precision Drills Sequence (PDS) squad. As the In-Charge, I am tasked with teaching my cadets and fellow squadmates. I feel that being in PDS teaches resilience as an immense amount of time and effort is needed to master the drills and stunts. However, PDS has never felt dreadful or unappealing as I came to learn them of my own volition. I truly feel that PDS is my passion and I would never give up the opportunity to learn new tricks."*

<div style="text-align:right;">~Nurhilmi bin Nurfaizal, Precision Drill Sequence I/C</div>


*“Although NPCC may seem like it is just solely focused on hard skills, over time, it taught me numerous leadership skills. To me, NPCC has helped me come out of my shell and helped me with not just hard skills, also with building my confidence and leadership qualities, all of which can be applied in the future. When teaching my cadets, it can feel tiring and stressful, but the rewarding feeling that I get after successfully teaching is truly incomparable.”*
