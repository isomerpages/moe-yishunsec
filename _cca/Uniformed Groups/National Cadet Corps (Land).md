<p>Reflecting on my promotion to the rank of Major marks a culmination of
twelve years in service with the National Cadet Corps. Throughout this
journey, the spirit of adventure has been a constant companion, urging
me to push boundaries and explore new horizons.</p>
<p>Central to my experience has been the privilege of learning alongside
with dedicated teacher officers and developing young cadets into confident
leaders. The camaraderie among colleagues has been a source of strength,
fostering a collaborative environment where we strive towards common goals
to achieve NCC vision and mission.</p>
