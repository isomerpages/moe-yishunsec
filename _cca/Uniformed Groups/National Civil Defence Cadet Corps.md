### Students’ Quotes

*“NCDCC has taught me how to learn, adapt, and overcome challenges that I may face. During these four years, I not only passed out from NCDCC with pride, I have also gained skills and knowledge such as Rescue, Life Saving Skills, and Fire Safety. Like everyone else, I faced difficulties in NCDCC such as a lack of confidence. However, I have overcome these challenges by getting support from my seniors, friends and teachers who encouraged me to be confident. This motivated and inspired me to push forward. I really enjoyed being in NCDCC with those opportunities that it had given me, which boosted me to become a person of good character. I will most definitely treasure the moments I had in NCDCC.”*

*“NCDCC has shaped me into a better individual and a leader. In my four years at NCDCC, I did not only learn life-saving skills, but certain skills not taught in the classroom, such as being courageous and confident in my leadership capabilities. With the unwavering help and support from the teachers-in-charge and officers, I learnt that communication is key and I'm confident the skills I learnt will be useful in the future, for many years to come.”*

<div style="text-align:right;">Mohammed Aaqil Bin Mohammed Rashid, ASM 2021-2022</div>

*“Among the many things NCDCC has taught me, the greatest thing it ever taught was that leadership was like a durian. Durians are spiky and hard on the outside, but soft and sweet on the inside. This mirrors how in leadership, you have to be tough and strict with those under you, but at the end of the day, you need to understand and empathise with their struggles to truly be successful. This is but a single lesson that NCDCC taught me over my four fruitful years of membership, and as arduous and tiring it may seem I would never pass up the opportunity to do it all over again.”*
