<p><em>“NCDCC has taught me responsibility, gave me lifelong bonds, and provided opportunities I'll forever be grateful for. Despite the challenges, my squad supported me through it all. NCDCC will always have a special place in my heart."</em>
</p>
<p>- Jaydias Ng (former USM)</p>
<p><em>“NCDCC taught me life-saving skills, teamwork, and invaluable life lessons. I've experienced many emotions, but have no regrets. I'm thankful for the amazing people who guided me and for the honour of serving as the ASM for my unit. NCDCC has shaped me to be a better leader and a better person.”</em>

I realized that my squad mates will always be there for me during my struggles and with patience, we can get through the tough times together. I have also realised that with patience and drive, any challenges can be overcome and NCDCC has helped me grow.”</em>
