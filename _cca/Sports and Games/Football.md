continues to be a part of the School Football Academy (SFA). The programme
continues to focus on nurturing young players by providing them with the
opportunity to learn from experienced coaches and equipping them with the
necessary resources to succeed. This year marks an exciting development
with the inclusion of the newly formed N2 Cluster Football Girls. Together,
they have showcased their potential and talent which highlights the programme’s
dedication to developing well-rounded athletes through various friendly

<p><strong>National School Games (NSG): </strong>Through NSG 2024, our teams
not only honed their skills but also embodied the essence of teamwork and
resilience. We are immensely proud of our ‘C’ boys, who fought their way
to the League 4 semi-finals, displaying exceptional talent and determination
every step of the way. Our football girls, participating in the NSG for
the first time, captured our hearts with their tenacity and unwavering
spirit, making a strong impression in their debut. The ‘B’ boys, too, stood
out with their relentless perseverance, embodying the grit and pride that
define our school’s sporting spirit.</p>
