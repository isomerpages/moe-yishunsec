### Highlights / Achievements

### Events in 2023

* YSS Under-18 Football League 2021: The teachers of Yishun Secondary Football CCA planned a league for the ‘B’ boys. The students participated in groups of 5 (4 players and 1 reserve with rolling substitute). Once a week on Thursdays, the boys competed against one another. What awaited them at the end of the league, were placings and medals for those who fought the hardest.
* E-CCA: Our boys continued to reflect on their performance and work on their SMART goals to further refine their skills and continue with their physical training in the comforts of their own home.
