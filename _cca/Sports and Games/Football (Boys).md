### Highlights / Achievements

* Inter-class Futsal Carnival for Secondary 1 to 5 classes in pursuit of a healthy lifestyle while building teamwork, friendship and camaraderie.
* Organised Yishun Invitational Football Carnival for the years 2017 – 2019 where opportunities were given for players from four different schools to hone and pitch their skills against each other. Our boys did us proud and clinched 1st place in 2019.
* Embarked on the yearly NSG Football Tournament where our ‘B’ and ‘C’ Divisions boys gained invaluable experience.
* Embarked on Seasonal Football League from 2016 – 2019. Our boys learnt to appreciate the positive characteristics learnt through the games such as teamwork, discipline and perseverance.

### Events in 2023

* YSS Under-18 Football League 2021: The teachers of Yishun Secondary Football CCA planned a league for the ‘B’ boys. The students participated in groups of 5 (4 players and 1 reserve with rolling substitute). Once a week on Thursdays, the boys competed against one another. What awaited them at the end of the league, were placings and medals for those who fought the hardest.
* E-CCA: Our boys continued to reflect on their performance and work on their SMART goals to further refine their skills and continue with their physical training in the comforts of their own home.
