### Student’s quotes

*“Netball taught me that a sport is not just about gameplay or skills. It is about perseverance and teamwork. When I was first appointed as the captain, I did not have confidence. However, with encouragement from my teachers, teammates, and coach I gained my confidence and believed in myself. I learned to lead and motivate the team. Lastly, through these three years, with guidance from my teachers, teammates, and coach, I learned to be a better person, teammate, and netball player.”*
