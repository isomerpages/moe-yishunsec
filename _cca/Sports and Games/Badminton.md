<h3>Student’s Quotes</h3>
<p><em>"Leading a badminton team has brought me many sensations while I served my duties with the team. Throughout my 3 years in this CCA, I have learnt that badminton is not just a sport, but rather a community that teaches us to mature through companionships, possess great team spirit and take home many valuable life lessons with us. Participating in the National School Games was of my most significant milestone with the team, as we encouraged each other with a positive mindset and a “no giving up” spirit. My teammates were fighting vociferously, offering words of motivation and support which led to our 3-2 victory. It was a fulfilling and memorable experience that I would not be a able to attain anywhere else, which gave me a strong sense of belonging towards the CCA and made my 3 years in this school twice as exciting."</em>

<p><em>"At first, being the badminton captain did not appeal to me as I was aware of the responsibilities of being a captain. Thankfully, after being selected as the captain, I was able to make meaningful and valuable memories with my CCA mates and teachers. Being the captain was definitely challenging at times as I had to lead my fellow CCA mates and I had to be a role model to my juniors. Thankfully, my CCA mates were supportive of me and they constantly encouraged me to reach greater heights. During the National School Games period, I had fun with my CCA mates and they taught me not to give up when met with setbacks. With the support of my teachers and peers, I am able to become a more reliable and dependable captain."</em>
