### Student’s Quotes

*"As the chairperson for badminton CCA for three years, I fully understand the expectations from my teachers and coaches. Being the chairperson isn't an easy job, I used to have a hard time trying to fulfill all the tasks given by my teachers and thankfully I did not let them down. My success would not have been possible without the support and encouragement from my coaches, teachers, and friends. With that I would like to thank all of them for giving me memorable experiences in the CCA."*

*"Badminton was not my first choice during the selection of CCA in secondary 1. Having spent almost 3 years in badminton CCA, I realised that I hadn't regretted joining in here. My CCA experiences with my fellow CCA mates were interactive and unforgettable. I will never forget how we strived and worked hard together during the NSG period. They taught me not to give up even when we encountered strong opponents and always try my best in everything I do. I feel a strong sense of belonging to my CCA, and definitely enjoyed myself throughout these 3 years."*
