### Key Student Outcomes

We want to build a community of thinking photographers who are dedicated to deepen their craft and have the courage to explore beyond what they know. We hope to build this community so that everyone will have more confidence to step out of their comfort zone and be resilient in putting in our 100% into the work that we are assigned to.

### Aperture Events in 2022

### Student’s Quotes

*"Being in aperture has shown me what it is like to be living life through a lens -with special moments that are caught in a second, but to be treasured for a lifetime.’'*
