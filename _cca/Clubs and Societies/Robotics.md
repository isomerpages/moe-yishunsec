### Highlights / Achievements

Robotics continues to provide enriching learning opportunities for our YSS Robotics through a variety of activities. The mini-challenges during CCA training sessions and external competitions help foster camaraderie, imbue resilience and showcase innovation and creativity as we strive for excellence. In 2020, students took part in 3D-Tronics Microbit Asia Challenge, organised by Zenitant and Tinkercademy, and supported by LearnSG and IMDA. In this competition, Jadon Lim Zhuo Zheng from 3E1 won the Explorer Award for the Senior Category. His entry was chosen out of nearly 500 submissions. Congratulations on the great effort and wonderful achievement!
