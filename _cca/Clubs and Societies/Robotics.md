<h3>Key Student Outcomes</h3>
<p>To promote computational thinking for life-long learning.</p>
<h3>Highlights / Achievements</h3>
<p>Robotics continues to provide enriching learning opportunities for our
YSS Robotics through a variety of activities. The activities conducted
during CCA training sessions and external competitions help foster camaraderie,
imbue resilience and showcase innovation and creativity as we strive for
excellence.</p>
<p>In 2023, students attended a training programme which exposed them to
various technology domains and skillsets required for the 21st Century.
Students will gain an understanding of concepts such as IoT and wireless
connectivity technologies, learn about sensors and output of IoT systems.
The importance of security for IoT systems will also be discussed. They
also gained understanding of the data analysis process and how their data
collected from IoT systems can be visualized, analysed, and presented using
a data analytics visual representation software.</p>
<p>In July 2023, our students took part in Ngee Ann Polytechnic Aerobot Challenge.
The Aerobot Challenge aims to interest Secondary 2 and 3 students in autonomous
technology. This event requires students to work in teams to solve simulated
real-world problems using drones and robots. A group of our students came
in 2nd place for this challenge.</p>
<p>In August 2030, more than 230 talented students from 51 different schools
immersed themselves in an exhilarating 6-week journey and participated
in training to acquire AI skills, gearing up for an array of thrilling
tech challenges curated by Google Engineersâ€”all in pursuit of the National
Youth Tech Championship 2023. Our group of 4 students took part and in
came in 7th place for the competition.</p>
