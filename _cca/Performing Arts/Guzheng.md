### Student’s Quotes

*“Guzheng has taught me many values like respect and resilience. As Guzheng is a CCA that heavily relies on teamwork, respect is essential in guzheng so as to achieve cohesion. Resilience is also another important value I fostered as i was faced with many challenges in the CCA. One of the most memorable experiences in the CCA is definitely the performances. Although it maybe nerve racking to perform in front of an audience, it also brings a sense of fulfilment and accomplishment.”*

*“During my time learning how to play guzheng, I have learned many values, as well as the skills of playing guzheng. It is both fun and entertaining to be in guzheng, as knowing how to play guzheng gives me a sense of accomplishment. In addition to the CCA, I have also grown from an immature person to someone who can handle responsibilities and I will cherish this experience of growth for the rest of my life.”*

*“Despite having experience in guzheng before joining YSS, I still found areas of improvements such as teamwork, perseverance, and hand coordination. What I learnt through guzheng is that we should trust each other by heart. We are united no matter the distance. We went through ups and downs together, but we should never give up no matter what the results are. What matters the most is that we all tried our best.”*

*“As a member of guzheng for the past 3 years, I've noticed the many positive sides of guzheng, not as a co-curriculum activity, but also as one big family. Guzheng may not have the most members of all the CCAs, but despite that, we have as one moved through, over and past many challenges.  my years in Yishun secondary school's one and only guzheng has taught me to work better with my peers and taught me the lesson of how great cooperation leads to great results, and I am eternally grateful and I will uphold my role of vice-chair will serve my position with the most of my ability and all that I can.”*
