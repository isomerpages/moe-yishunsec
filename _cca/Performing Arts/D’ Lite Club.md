### Student’s Quotes

*"D’lite Drama Club expanded my knowledge and interest in theatre. Being in the drama club taught me many interesting things like learning how to act as a different character while being able to express myself, managing the stage, directing plays, and improvising on the spot. As the President, I am more than willing to pass on my excitement in theatre to my club members and take the club to greater heights."*

*"D’lite has given me countless things, from learning new skills to making new friends. This club also gives me the chance to try new things and to explore the world of acting. I have tried many things, acting, making props and even playing traditional music. To add on, being in this club, I get to experience the rush of SYF performances, how everyone manages their own role and the feelings before and after a performance on stage. Without D’lite, I doubt I would have experienced these thrilling events!"*

*“Being in D’Lite has helped me build my confidence and expand my interest in theatre. In D’Lite, I not only learnt how to express myself on stage when acting, but also learnt the different types of props that needs to be used and the placement of props matter in a drama play. To me, D’Lite is a very big family that never fails to welcome each other. When I first joined D’Lite, I was a very shy person, but slowly I began to open up as the environment in D’Lite was very inclusive and warm. I made many new friends and created many wonderful memories with them. Without D’lite, I would have never made these fond memories with my friends.”*

I learnt how to make many new props and how the tiniest details matter in a drama play. D'Lite has definitely made me feel welcomed, being able to express myself freely. Without D'Lite, I am certain that I would have never made these fond memories with my friends and peers."*
