### Key Student Outcomes

* Students gain exposure to and keen awareness in music cutting across various genres, geographical regions and time periods.
* Each chorister is expected to master good vocal production techniques and attain a degree of musical competency by the end of the 4 year tenure.
* Constant participation in performances, like the SYF and the Night Festival, enable students to learn performance etiquette and hone skills that pique their awareness of onstage demands – professionalism, precision, and discipline.
* Students are also trained to take up leadership positions, lead warm-ups, run programmes and develop areas of competency beyond training in music.
* Students are also involved in service learning at community clubs and hospitals to develop empathy and make a difference in others’ lives.

### Student’s Quotes

*“One reason I join is that I get to express myself, although I am generally a shy person. The experience of singing together, learning together is rather fun, and we get to learn through the mistakes. I also enjoy the teaching, which allows me to grow musically.”*
