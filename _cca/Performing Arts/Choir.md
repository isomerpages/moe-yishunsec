### Key Student Outcomes

* The choir goals are three-pronged. The key aim is to nurture a love for music and develop the student’s mastery in choral singing. Our constant participation in performances aims to hone vocal skills and refine performance etiquette, piquing their awareness of onstage demands – professionalism, precision, and discipline.
* The CCA hopes to provide opportunity for personal growth. It encourages each individual to take up leadership roles, to run warm-ups and programmes, and develop areas of competency beyond aspects of music.
* The choir is also involved in service learning to develop empathy and make a difference in others’ lives through community involvement.

### Student’s Quotes

*“One reason I join is that I get to express myself, although I am generally a shy person. The experience of singing together, learning together is rather fun, and we get to learn through the mistakes. I also enjoy the teaching, which allows me to grow musically.”*
