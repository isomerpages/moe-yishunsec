*"Modern dance has taught me many values such as perseverance and teamwork. I have learnt that I should always aim to do my best during training and performances. Events such as Super 24 gave me the exposure to perform on a public stage which allows me to grow as a dancer. My coach, teachers-in-charge, and friends are always there to encourage me and push me beyond my limits. Overall, I enjoy my time in the modern dance club. "*
