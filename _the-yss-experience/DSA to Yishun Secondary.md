##### General Information about Direct School Admission (Secondary) 2023

The Direct School Admission-Secondary (DSA-Sec) scheme provides students with the opportunity to seek admission to a secondary school, based on a diverse range of specific academic and non-academic achievements and talents that they can demonstrate beyond the PSLE.

From 4 May 2023, application for DSA-Sec can be submitted through the online DSA-Sec Portal. The application is free-of-charge and will be open from 4 May to 31 May 2023. For more details, please refer to MOE website – https://www.moe.gov.sg/secondary/dsa.

Parents and students are encouraged to choose schools wisely based on the student’s aptitudes and strengths, bearing in mind the school’s academic and non-academic requirements, and the programmes available to develop the area of talent.
