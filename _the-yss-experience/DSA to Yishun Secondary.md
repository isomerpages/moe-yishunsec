##### General Information about Direct School Admission (Secondary) 2023

The Direct School Admission-Secondary (DSA-Sec) scheme provides students with the opportunity to seek admission to a secondary school, based on a diverse range of specific academic and non-academic achievements and talents that they can demonstrate beyond the PSLE.

From 4 May 2023, application for DSA-Sec can be submitted through the online DSA-Sec Portal. The application is free-of-charge and will be open from 4 May to 31 May 2023. For more details, please refer to MOE website – https://www.moe.gov.sg/secondary/dsa.

Parents and students are encouraged to choose schools wisely based on the student’s aptitudes and strengths, bearing in mind the school’s academic and non-academic requirements, and the programmes available to develop the area of talent.
DSA-Sec @Yishun Secondary School

All Secondary One students admitted to our school via DSA-Sec will benefit from our talent development programmes to develop their potential, and/or to be groomed to be leaders in their respective talent areas. They will develop both performance and moral character through our customised programme as they grow within their respective CCAs and student development programmes.
