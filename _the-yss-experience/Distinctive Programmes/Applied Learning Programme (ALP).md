### Arts for Life and Community

Consisting of two elements Applied Learning Programme (ALP) and Lifelong Learning Programme (LLP), Yishun Secondary School’s Distinctive Programme (DP) centres around sonic arts, music arrangement and technology with an outreach to the community in mind. Students embark on a journey of discovery, from exploring the different facet of sonic arts and developing their interest in music.

The holistic programme takes on a 3-tiered approach where all students, at Tier 1, learn to appreciate sonic arts through school assembly programmes, music lessons, and Student-Initiated Learning (SIL) modules. Passionate students are further stretched in music masterclasses and will have opportunities to showcase their work. By Tier 3, students are involved in performances, productions, and partnerships with institutes of higher learning and overseas collaborations.

### Key Programmes

#### Artist-in-School Scheme (AISS)

This initiative by the National Arts Council (NAC) supports partnership between Singapore artists and mainstream schools. It allows schools to co-design customized arts learning experiences that deepen students’ engagement in and through the arts. Working closely with James Lye of Makor Records, students are exposed to fundamentals of popular song genres. They are also equipped with basic MIDI playing and recording skills.

#### Student-Initiated Learning (SIL)

Implemented nationwide in 2021, Student-Initiated Learning (SIL) is a component of Home-Based Learning days where time is set aside for students to pursue their own interests and learn beyond the textbooks. In YSS, SIL modules are aligned to our DP such as digital drawings and creating videos that captures their interests such as football juggling, dancing, and A Day in the Life Of amongst other things.


#### Sonic Arts and Music (SAM) Week

YSS engages different vendors to spark an interest in sonic arts and music. Some of the programmes that were done include DJ-ing, Manga drawing, and KPop dancing.

#### Mother Tongue Broadcasting

In YSS, we strongly believe in inter-disciplinary education experience. Collaborating with the Mother Tongue department, students can interview and interact with their fellow Yishunites in various settings involving the arts and creating a video to summarise it.

#### Arts Extravaganza

A highly anticipated annual school event, the Arts Extravaganza provides a platform for Yishunites to present their involvement in the arts to the community. They do not only showcase their performing arts pieces, but also encourages students who are not involved in performing arts CCA to showcase their talents. One such programme is the school’s singing competition, Vocalistic. On top of that, students who stand out during the SIL programme and SAM week were also given an exposure to demonstrate and showcase their works during Meet-the-Artists sessions. In 2023, the Arts Extravaganza was held in Yishun Town Square. It was a successful event, which garnered the support of parents and members of the community. Truly, this event encapsulates what DP in YSS stands for: Arts for Life and Community.
