Yishun Secondary School’s (YSS) ALP in Sonic Arts centres around music composition, media and technology. Students embark on a journey of discovery, from developing their interest in music through the GMP to learning technology by creating music and video production.

  

Helmed by a dedicated group of educators, they ensure that Sonic Arts engages and impacts students. The programme takes on a 3-tiered approach where all students, at Tier 1, learn to appreciate music through school assembly programme, music lessons and student-led lunch time concerts. Passionate students are further exposed to music creation like song writing, recording and video production. By Tier 3, students are involved in performances, productions and partnerships with institutes of higher learning and overseas collaborations.

  

Concurrently, YSS has fine-tuned its LLP with an arts element in community service, and coined both Distinctive Programmes as “Arts for Life and Community”. Other contributing success factors include the school-based tiered approach and sustained partnership with external organisations. To share this journey with the fraternity, YSS welcomes attachment of teachers or sharing at various platforms.
