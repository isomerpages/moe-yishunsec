### ‘LEADING WITH EMPATHY, SERVING WITH COMPASSION THROUGH THE ARTS’


Yishun Secondary School’s (YSS) LLP in Community Youth Leadership (CYL) focuses on honing leadership skills in students and cultivating a sense of belonging to the community through purposeful service.  


In YSS, we believe in nurturing every Yishunite to have the confidence to lead and be committed to serving the needs of the underprivileged and disadvantaged. This we hope will cultivate an attitude of life-long volunteerism applying various elements of the arts. 


The programme ‘Leading with Empathy, Serving with Compassion through the Arts’ aims to support students in developing themselves so that they are able to serve their peers and continue on to impact the community through different forms of arts, fulfilling our school’s vision of Quality Mind Caring Heart. Through the provision of structured leadership trainings and authentic learning experiences, students will be able to lead and participate actively based on the understanding and identification of school and community needs. 

  

#### Objectives of the programme


1.  To develop skills and attributes, including student leadership competencies, as well as arts-related attributes, that enable the students to contribute to the betterment of society as socially responsible citizens
2.  To leverage arts as a means to reach out and engage the community, from the youths to the elderly, with diverse social backgrounds (including the disabled and disadvantaged)
3.  To use arts to express and document the students’ plan and execution of the project, as well as with the residents/targeted audience, to express the shared sentiments, love and aspirations for the targeted community and for Yishun, thereby contributing in making the neighbourhood a vibrant arts and cultural scene
4.  To engage targeted audience/residents in the community in the co-creation of the arts (community arts), and to display and share their art works at community places (hawker centres and food courts, void decks and town centres/CCs, parks and playgrounds, shopping malls), thereby embracing arts as an integral part of their lives

Our school aspires to equip all students with the knowledge and skills necessary to be better leaders of the community by discovering and leading oneself (Developing Self), inspiring and impacting others (Serving Peers) and subsequently making a positive change in our community (Impacting Community). Our students exhibit these attributes with a focus in arts through the progression from self expression to group expression and leading to community arts.

  

At the first tier, the programme ensures that all students are equipped with leadership skills and art-related competencies. Through the provision of opportunities to work with different facets of the community, students progressively develop to be active contributors and leaders of the community. The second tier involves students with greater aptitude and interest as well as our student leaders carrying out a self-directed project, leveraging the skills and competencies acquired.  

  

Concurrently, YSS has coined both Distinctive Programmes ALP and LLP as “Arts for Life and Community”. To share this journey with the fraternity, YSS welcomes attachment of teachers or sharing at various platforms.

#### LLP KEY PROGRAMMES 2021

  

*   This year, Sec 3 students designed and hand-painted coin pouches which were packed together with social game sets into paper bags to be delivered to homes of the residents at Yishun rental blocks, Sree Narayana Mission Home for the Aged and Anglican Senior Centre (Yishun). The sides of the paper bag have been specially decorated and the handle has been tagged with a card of handwritten heartwarming message. Students also produced a video on how to play the social game set as well as the benefits of the game as part of their outreach to the residents in the collaboration with North West CDC.

*   Our second outreach project with North West CDC involved students from 2T1 where they connected with residents in Yishun rental blocks and Anglican Senior Centre (Yishun) through Do-It-Yourself (DIY) crafts. Our students prepared and packed materials such as yarn, non-slip mat, pom-pom cardboard template, scissors and penknife into tote bags to be delivered to the homes of the residents and the centre. Residents learnt step by step to make a pom-pom rug through an instructional video produced by our students. The activity encourages creativity and hands-on skills of the residents.

*   Another outreach project with North West CDC involved students from 2T2 where they packed 300 festive goodie bags for the needy families within the North West District. The annual Festive Goodies Packing and Distribution aims to spread festive cheers to the needy families in conjunction with the Lunar Chinese New Year. The goodie bags were then couriered over to the rental blocks in Yishun where they were distributed by the corporate partners.  
      
    Our students geared up their energy to pack and arrange the groceries such as instant noodles, beverages, can food, biscuits and cereals into tote bags. The class organised themselves into various stations for the packing to be done in an orderly manner while observing safety management measures (SMM). All in all, the students sweat it out in a fun and meaningful way!

*   Selected Sec 1 and 2 students who showed greater aptitude had the opportunity to serve the elderly residents in Sree Narayana Mission Home. The students lead with empathy by preparing art and craft packages containing materials for the making of paper fans as well as fully constructed paper fans to be delivered to the home. Residents were soaked in the spirit of National Day celebration as the paper fans were constructed using red and white coloured papers. Both the colours represented the colours of the Singapore flag serve to remind and celebrate the values of unity and equality of all races. The paper fans were used by the residents to fan themselves or some used as decoration on their side table. The purposeful service from the heart lifted the spirits of the elderlies.

*   Through the Art curriculum and classroom experience, a selected group of 20 students produced 20 pieces of art works with the theme of ‘Nature’. The art works were delivered to Sengkang Community Hospital (SCH) for display and exhibition in the building, as part of the SchoolARTS@SKH Campus Programme. Our students were able to show care and bring joy to the community (staff, patients and public) in hospitals especially SCH Campus through artwork.
