Learning for Life Programme (LLP)
=================================

  

**‘LEADING WITH EMPATHY, SERVING WITH COMPASSION THROUGH THE ARTS’**   

  

Yishun Secondary School’s (YSS) LLP in Community Youth Leadership (CYL) focuses on honing leadership skills in students and cultivating a sense of belonging to the community through purposeful service.  

  

In YSS, we believe in nurturing every Yishunite to have the confidence to lead and be committed to serving the needs of the underprivileged and disadvantaged. This we hope will cultivate an attitude of life-long volunteerism applying various elements of the arts. 

  

The programme ‘Leading with Empathy, Serving with Compassion through the Arts’ aims to support students in developing themselves so that they are able to serve their peers and continue on to impact the community through different forms of arts, fulfilling our school’s vision of Quality Mind Caring Heart. Through the provision of structured leadership trainings and authentic learning experiences, students will be able to lead and participate actively based on the understanding and identification of school and community needs. 

  

**Objectives of the programme:**

  

1.  To develop skills and attributes, including student leadership competencies, as well as arts-related attributes, that enable the students to contribute to the betterment of society as socially responsible citizens
2.  To leverage arts as a means to reach out and engage the community, from the youths to the elderly, with diverse social backgrounds (including the disabled and disadvantaged)
3.  To use arts to express and document the students’ plan and execution of the project, as well as with the residents/targeted audience, to express the shared sentiments, love and aspirations for the targeted community and for Yishun, thereby contributing in making the neighbourhood a vibrant arts and cultural scene
4.  To engage targeted audience/residents in the community in the co-creation of the arts (community arts), and to display and share their art works at community places (hawker centres and food courts, void decks and town centres/CCs, parks and playgrounds, shopping malls), thereby embracing arts as an integral part of their lives
