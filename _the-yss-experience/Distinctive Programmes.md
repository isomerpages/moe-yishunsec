<h3>Arts for Life and Community</h3>
<p>Consisting of two elements Applied Learning Programme (ALP) and Lifelong
Learning Programme (LLP), Yishun Secondary School’s Distinctive Programme
(DP) centres around sonic arts, music arrangement and technology with an
outreach to the community in mind. Students embark on a journey of discovery,
from exploring the different facet of sonic arts and developing their interest
in music.</p>

<p>The holistic programme takes on a 3-tiered approach where all students,
at Tier 1, learn to appreciate sonic arts through school assembly programmes,
music lessons, and Student-Initiated Learning (SIL) modules. Passionate
students are further stretched in music masterclasses and will have opportunities
to showcase their work. By Tier 3, students are involved in performances,
productions, and partnerships with institutes of higher learning and overseas
collaborations.</p>
<h3>Key Programmes</h3>
<h4>Student-Initiated Learning (SIL)</h4>
<p>Implemented nationwide in 2021, Student-Initiated Learning (SIL) is a
component of Home-Based Learning days where time is set aside for students
to pursue their own interests and learn beyond the textbooks. In YSS, SIL
modules are aligned to our DP such as digital drawings and creating videos
that captures their interests such as football juggling, dancing, and A
Day in the Life Of amongst other things.</p>
<h4>Sonic Arts and Music (SAM) Week</h4>
<p>YSS engages different vendors to spark an interest in sonic arts and music.
Some of the programmes that were done include DJ-ing, Manga drawing, and
KPop dancing.</p>

<h4>Mother Tongue Broadcasting</h4>
<p>In YSS, we strongly believe in inter-disciplinary education experience.
Collaborating with the Mother Tongue department, students can interview
and interact with their fellow Yishunites in various settings involving
the arts and creating a video to summarise it.</p>

<p>A highly anticipated annual school event, the Arts Extravaganza provides
a platform for Yishunites to present their involvement in the arts to the
community. They do not only showcase their performing arts pieces, but
also encourages students who are not involved in performing arts CCA to
showcase their talents. One such programme is the school’s singing competition,
Vocalistic. On top of that, students who stand out during the SIL programme
and SAM week were also given an exposure to demonstrate and showcase their
works during Meet-the-Artists sessions. In 2023, the Arts Extravaganza
was held in Yishun Town Square. It was a successful event, which garnered
the support of parents and members of the community. Truly, this event
encapsulates what DP in YSS stands for: Arts for Life and Community.</p>
