<h2>Arts for Life and Community</h2>
<p>Consisting of two elements Applied Learning Programme (ALP) and Lifelong
Learning Programme (LLP), Yishun Secondary School’s Distinctive Programme
(DP) centres around sonic arts, music arrangement and technology with an
outreach to the community in mind. Students embark on a journey of discovery,
from exploring the different facet of sonic arts and developing their interest
in music.</p>

<p>The holistic programme adopts a three-tiered approach to develop students'
appreciation and talent in sonic arts. At <strong>Tier 1</strong>, all students
are introduced to sonic arts through music lessons. In Secondary 1, they
acquire foundational music knowledge, while in Secondary 2, they explore
music technology in collaboration with industry professionals.</p>
<p>At <strong>Tier 2</strong>, students with a deeper passion for music are
further nurtured through specialised masterclasses and gain hands-on experience
recording their work in the school’s in-house recording studio. They are
also given platforms to showcase their talents, such as the annual singing
competition, Vocalistic and the performing arts festival, Arts Extravaganza.</p>
<p>By <strong>Tier 3</strong>, selected students represent the school in external
music competitions and participate in community engagement performances,
allowing them to contribute back to the community through the arts.</p>
<h3>Key Programmes</h3>

<p>The Arts Extravaganza is a dynamic and inclusive celebration that offers
Yishunites the opportunity to present their involvement in various art
forms to the school and the broader community. This event showcases the
works of students from the Performing Arts Co-Curricular Activities (CCAs)
and the Music and Arts Students.</p>
<p>This year's Arts Extravaganza revolves around the theme of "Expressions",
symbolising the students' ability to share their unique talents and creativity
with the audience through various forms of artistic expression. The theme
emphasises the importance of self-expression, allowing students to communicate
their emotions, thoughts, and personal stories through their performances
and artwork. The event was a great success, drawing strong support from
the school, parents and members of the community.</p>
