are able to appreciate and question the world they live in with the hope
to groom empathetic and informed global citizens.</p>

<p>Through engaging experiences in the Humanities classroom and the supplementation
of the Key Initiatives, students draw connections between their own lived
experiences and the larger national, regional and global events that shape
the world we live in. The use of inquiry as the main anchor for the classroom
experience allows the student space to think critically, ask questions
and make reasoned judgements. This is demonstrated in day-to-day conversations
with the students and also through commendable competition results such
as achieving a Certificate of Achievement (Bronze) for the NUS Geography
Challenge and coming in 2nd place for the NLB S.U.R.E. competition.</p>
<h3>Department Key Initiatives</h3>
<h5>Humanities Inquiry</h5>
<p>The inquiry process, whereby students are guided through the ability to
ask questions about the content they are learning and draw conclusions
from sources of information, forms the core of the Humanities. To support
this process of inquiry, each unit has designed engaging learning journeys
that will allow students to learn beyond the confines of their classroom
and to apply their learning to the actual real-world context. Learning
journeys include:</p>

<li>
<p>Sec 1 Historical Investigation to Eurasian Heritage Gallery, Indian Heritage
Centre and Sun Yat Sen Nanyang Memorial Hall</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sec 3 Pure Geography Investigation at East Coast Beach</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sec 3 Social Studies Investigation at The Enabling Village</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h5>Humanities Talent Management</h5>
<p>Year-round, students from across the various levels and streams are selected
to represent the school in competitions. Most notable ones include the
NUS Geography Challenge, NLB S.U.R.E competition, Historical Scene Investigation
and the MOE History challenge.</p>
<h5>Southeast Asian Programme</h5>
<p>Every year, a group of Secondary 2 students are selected to take part
in the Southeast Asian Programme where they learn more about the region
they live in through talks by academics as well as sharing by their peers
on how the interconnection between Southeast Asian countries are vital
to the survival of this region. This year, they will also embark on interactive
sessions such as trying their hands on the Gamelan and Batik painting as
they learn about the deep cultural heritage of the region. They will also
be going on a learning journey to the National Gallery Singapore where
they will learn more about art and architecture that defines Southeast
Asia.</p>
