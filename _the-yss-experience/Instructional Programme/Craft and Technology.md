<h2>Goal</h2>
<p>To nurture students into thinkers, innovators, and contributors</p>
<h2>Key Programmes</h2>
<p>Craft and Technology subjects (Art, Design &amp; Technology, Food &amp;
Nutrition, Food Studies, Food &amp; Consumer Education) are aligned to
the 21st Century Competencies required by students to be thinkers, innovators
and contributors. Through coursework, students are exposed to thinking
and innovation techniques such as project management, art awareness and
appreciation, nutrition planning, problems identification, research, decision
making, empathy and safety consciousness so that they are able to contribute
to the community.</p>
<p><strong>DESIGN &amp; TECHNOLOGY </strong>adopts the Design Thinking process
to explore real-world design opportunities and students propose ideas based
on their research and ideation. Students’ thinking is cultivated through
different methods of sketching and drawing, questioning techniques and
the joy of learning by using real-life authentic situations coupled with
computer-aided design software for product design on structures and designs.
These activities, together with mini projects, enable students to experience
authentic design opportunities with empathy and critical thinking, thus
honing their problem-solving skills.</p>
<p><strong>D&amp;T Programme</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Lower Secondary Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>The programme focuses to create interest and awareness in design at the
lower secondary level through:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>exposure to elements of the design process,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>basic 3D sketching,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>understanding technological areas in structures, mechanisms and electronics,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>hands-on projects that allow individual creativity and problem-solving.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Upper Secondary Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>At the upper secondary level, the aim is to inculcate creativity and innovative
spirit through:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>involvement in the rigour of the design process through the building up
of a design journal,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>acquiring skills, making of mock-ups and prototypes, and production of
presentation boards,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>development of advanced workshop process skills.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>VISUAL ARTS </strong>adopts the multi-disciplinary approach.</p>
<p><strong>Art Programme</strong>
</p>
<p><strong><em>Lower Secondary Programme</em></strong>
</p>
<p>At the lower secondary level, students are exposed to not only 2-dimensional
art-making. Students get to develop their visual-spatial intelligence through
the mixed medium sculptures. These enable students to immerse and explore
3-dimensional constructs to communicate their thoughts, ideas and be adept
at understanding and appreciating the form of an object. This is to cultivate
a sense of wonder whilst enjoying the process of discovery.</p>
<p><strong><em>Upper Secondary Programme</em></strong>
</p>
<p>At the upper secondary level, the focus is on Studio Practice. Studio
Practice engages students in the creation of artworks. Students hone their
observation skills, learn to discriminate visual qualities and give form
to their ideas and experiences when they are engaged in art making. The
Studio Practice provides opportunities for students to acquire a working
understanding of various art elements and principles. It also develops
competency in manipulating various art media for self-expression. Students
would be given opportunities to explore a good range of media and experiment
with different techniques in their studio practice.</p>
<p><strong>NUTRITION &amp; FOOD SCIENCE</strong> develops students’ critical
thinking and culinary skills as they apply their learning to contribute
towards the community. The experiences promote an extension of learning
and inventive thinking where students look into emerging food and health
trends, examine the different characteristics of food, investigate and
apply scientific principles for food preparation, before making informed
decisions in designing and creating innovative health-enhancing food products
to contribute positively to the community.</p>
<p><strong>NFS Programme</strong>
</p>
<p><strong><em>Lower Secondary Food &amp; Consumer Education</em></strong>
</p>
<p>The lower secondary Food &amp; Consumer Education (FCE) programme focuses
on:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>understanding the importance of nutrition for long-term health and applying
basic principles of consumer education,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>nurturing and developing a spirit of enterprise, innovation, aesthetic
awareness, problem-solving and creativity,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>inventive thinking where students look into emerging food and health trends,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>appreciating and developing an understanding of food and multicultural
literacy in the global context,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>making informed decisions in designing and creating innovative health-enhancing
food products to contribute positively to the community.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Upper Secondary Food &amp; Nutrition</em></strong>
</p>
<p>The upper secondary Food &amp; Nutrition (F&amp;N) programme delves at
a deeper level on:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>the principles of nutrition and concept of a balanced diet in meal planning
using nutritional tools and modification of recipes,</p>
