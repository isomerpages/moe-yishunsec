<h2>Goal</h2>
<p>To nurture students into thinkers, innovators, and contributors</p>
<h2>Key Programmes</h2>
<p>Craft and Technology subjects (Art, Design &amp; Technology, Food &amp;
Consumer Education, Nutrition &amp; Food Science) are aligned to the 21st
Century Competencies required by students to be thinkers, innovators and
contributors. Through coursework, students are exposed to thinking and
innovation techniques such as project management, art awareness and appreciation,
nutrition planning, food and consumer literacy, problems identification,
research, decision making, empathy and safety consciousness so that they
are able to contribute to the community.</p>
<p><strong>DESIGN &amp; TECHNOLOGY</strong> learning is mainly through design-and-make
projects guided by a design process. The design process entails identifying
design needs from real-world experiences, generating and developing ideas,
and realising the design solution; with research carried out when necessary.
Research includes testing ideas through quick mock-ups and evaluating the
final design solution with the intended user. In doing so, students acquire
related knowledge and develop skills to turn ideas into reality and values
like mindfulness, empathy and sensitivity in the areas of social, culture
and environment.</p>
<p><strong>Design &amp; Technology emphasises the following:</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>thinking through sketching to generate and to develop design solutions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>exploration and experimentation of ideas through mock-ups so as to allow
students to fail early in seeking a practical and appropriate design solution
for the identified user</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>making of the prototype as a cognitive and hands-on endeavour</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>D&amp;T Programme</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Lower Secondary Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>The lower secondary D&amp;T programme focuses on the development of freehand
sketching skills through idea generation and development and offers tactile
learning experiences for students to construct prototypes of the developed
ideas.</p>
<p>It aims to enable students to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>cultivate visual-spatial thinking through sketching, experimenting and
prototyping using appropriate materials and basic hand tools/equipment/machines
safely,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop an appreciation of function, aesthetics and technology in design
through everyday products and their implication on sustainability,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>exercise judgements for design appropriateness with respect to the users,
functionality and the environment,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop confidence and pride through turning ideas into physical objects.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The knowledge, skills and values gained at this level lay the foundation
for D&amp;T learning at the upper secondary level. In achieving the above
aims, students also develop safe working habits.</p>
<p><strong>Upper Secondary Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>At the upper secondary level, designing and making are dealt with at greater
depth and scope as all students can sketch and make. Students do research
to understand and define user needs, explore and develop design solutions,
and prototype their ideas using basic han tools/equipment/machines. Such
learning activities leverage and build on students’ experiences in design
and technology, with a focus on understanding of everyday activities to
create possibilities to make life better. In the process, students cultivate
creative, critical and reflective thinking and develop design related dispositions
and skills.</p>
<p>It aims to enable students to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>develop confidence, pride and tenacity through exploring real-world design
opportunities for which ideas are developed within a given timeframe;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop the quality of mindfulness, empathy and sensitivity through improving
some aspects of their environment in everyday life;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>embrace uncertainties, complexities and the inherent social dimension
of the design process when exploring design opportunities vis-à-vis design
ideas;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>cultivate thinking through doodling and sketching/drawing,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>experiment and prototype ideas using appropriate materials and tools;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>build on their innate curiosity and ability to create; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>exercise judgements and make evidence-based decisions of technological,
aesthetic and economic nature.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In achieving the above aims, students also develop safe working habits.</p>
<p><strong>VISUAL ARTS</strong> enables every student to enjoy art, communicate
visually, and make meaning through connecting with society and culture
and it adopts the multi-disciplinary approach.</p>
<p><strong>Art Programme</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Lower Secondary Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>At the lower secondary level, Art aims to develop students as active artists
and informed audience with:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Curious minds that are open to exploring and experimenting in art.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Critical and inventive thinking in creative expression.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Personal voice and capacity to collaborate with others in art.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An awareness, interest, and respect for art from diverse social and cultural
perspectives.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Students are exposed to not only 2-dimensional art-making. Students get
to develop their visual-spatial intelligence through the mixed medium sculptures.
These enable students to immerse and explore 3-dimensional constructs to
communicate their thoughts, ideas and be adept at understanding and appreciating
the form of an object. This is to cultivate a sense of wonder whilst enjoying
the process of discovery. Through these experiences, students will be able
to perceive, communicate and appreciate.</p>
<p><strong>Upper Secondary Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>At the upper secondary level, Art aims to develop students as active artists
and informed audience with:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Confidence to express artistic intent through visual language.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Critical, adaptive and inventive thinking to produce and evaluate creative
resolutions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Personal voice and capacity to reflect on self in relation to others in
art.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An understanding of, and respect for diverse social and cultural perspectives.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The focus is on Studio Practice to convey the three big ideas that are
central to Art – Art helps us to see in new ways; Art tells stories about
our world; Art influences how we live. To participate in art making and
conversations about artworks, students need to acquire knowledge, skills
and understanding across four areas of Learning Content – art forms and
media, visual qualities, visual strategies and design concepts, context
and artistic processes. The four areas interact and influence each other
in dynamic ways and serve as entry points to making, thinking and talking
about art.</p>
<p>Studio Practice engages students in the creation of artworks. Students
hone their observation skills, learn to discriminate visual qualities and
give form to their ideas and experiences when they are engaged in art making.
The Studio Practice provides opportunities for students to acquire a working
understanding of various art elements and principles. It also develops
competency in manipulating various art media for self-expression. Students
would be given opportunities to explore a good range of media and experiment
with different techniques in their studio practice.</p>
<p><strong>NUTRITION &amp; FOOD SCIENCE</strong> aims to build a strong foundation
in understanding the link between nutrition and good health, whereby students
will be cognisant of making informed food choices. Students will also be
able to apply food science principles in the area of food preparation and
cooking in creating healthier food products. At the same time, food sustainability
issues in Singapore will be introduced to create awareness of the nation’s
concern on food security. Through these experiences, students are nurtured
to be concerned citizens who take an active role in bettering the lives
of those around them through their knowledge in nutrition and health, food
literacy and food science.</p>
<p><strong>NFS Programme</strong>
