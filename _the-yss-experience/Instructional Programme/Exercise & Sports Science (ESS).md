<p>Exercise &amp; Sports Science is a new GCE O-Level subject to be introduced
in 2022. ESS uses movement as the focal point for performance, analysis
and critique. Students will understand the relationships amongst the sub-disciplines
of sports science and how systems within these sub-disciplines interact
to influence how the human body moves in relation to each other and in
different contexts. Movement contexts exist in specific exercises and sports,
which in turn, manifest themselves in why and how people exercise and participate
in sports in society, as influenced by socio-cultural factors such as commercialisation,
ethics and equity.</p>
