<h3>Lower Secondary Music Programme</h3>
<h4><strong>Secondary One Curriculum</strong></h4>
<h4>Instrument Fundamentals</h4>
<p>The Lower Secondary Music (LSM) Programme aims to equip Yishunites with
fundamental skills in at least two classroom instruments. They are taught
instrument anatomy, good posture, tuning, as well as playing techniques
such as strumming. Students are equipped with foundational techniques as
they perform popular songs in class. They also learn how to interpret chord
charts and utilise digital resources to learn collaboratively.</p>

<p>We firmly believe in encouraging students to engage in musicking beyond
the classroom. This year, our Secondary One students performed a rendition
of the traditional folk song Rasa Sayang for an Assembly programme commemorating
International Friendship Day.</p>

<h4>Performing Arts Based Learning (PABL)</h4>
<p>Another core experience in Secondary 1 is the Performing Arts Based Learning
(PABL) programme, Jointly developed and funded by the Ministry of Education
(MOE) and National Arts Council (NAC), PABL provides every student with
the opportunity to experience a live music performance in a professional
arts and cultural venue. In 2025, we were privileged to be an audience
to the Metropolitan Festival Orchestra (MFO), performing various arrangements
of Singapore songs. As part of the pre-concert curriculum, our Secondary
one students learned how to identify various orchestral instruments and
performed as an ensemble using the GarageBand application on iPads.</p>

<h4>Secondary Two Curriculum</h4>
<p>In recent years, students are increasingly normalised to consuming and
creating short-form media content through platforms such as TikTok, Youtube
and Instagram. In recognition of this, the Secondary Two Music curriculum
focuses on supporting them in arranging soundtracks to complement online
multimedia.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Video</p>
<h4>Artist-in-School Scheme (AISS)</h4>
<p>We are beneficiaries of the Artist-in-school scheme- an initiative by
the National Arts Council (NAC) that supports partnership between Singapore
artists and mainstream schools to co-design Arts curriculum. Since 2021,
we are privileged to be working closely with a team of instructors including
James Lye, an educator and Recording Artist (Maker Records) as well as
Eugene Soh, a songwriter and frontman-guitarist of local band Bakers in
Space amongst others.</p>

<h4>Upper Secondary Music programme </h4>
<p>At the Upper Secondary level, Normal (Technical) Music offers a broad-based
music education which enables students to further their interest in music.
Our students enjoy authentic, practical learning experiences across a range
of music genres, with music technology being an integral part of learning.</p>
<p>The Normal (Technical) Music syllabus aims to:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Develop musicianship in every student through the active triangulation
of listening, performing and creating. This aims to kickstart a life-long
engagement with the arts beyond the classroom</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Equip students with a range of music technology skills and develop an
awareness of real-world applications</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nurture resilient and creative problem-solvers who can make informed musical
decisions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cultivate students’ appreciation of music in local and global cultures
and their functions in society</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>At Secondary Three, our students perform at ASPIRE!, an annual concert
organised by Arts Education Branch (AEB) for Normal Technical Music students
to perform for the public. Rightly termed ASPIRE!, this showcase celebrates
and affirms our students’ resilience and dreams to bring their music to
a larger audience.</p>
<p>Some of the songs performed by Yishunites include Somewhere Only We Know
(Keane), Love Someone (Lukas Graham) and Billie Jean (Michael Jackson)
amongst others.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Video</p>
<p>On top of regular lessons, we are committed to expose our students to
industry-related experiences through enrichment programmes. Examples include</p>
