<h4>Artist-in-School Scheme (AISS)</h4>
<p>This initiative by the National Arts Council (NAC) supports partnership
between Singapore artists and mainstream schools. It allows schools to
co-design customized arts learning experiences that deepen students’ engagement
in and through the arts. Working closely with James Lye of Makor Records,
students are exposed to fundamentals of popular song genres. They are also
equipped with basic MIDI playing and recording skills.</p>
<h4>Music Masterclass (Selected Sec 2s)</h4>
<p>To further develop selected students who have passion and interest in
digital music making, going into post production skills such as mixing.</p>

<h4>Singapore Symphony Orchestra x Yishun Sec Performing Arts-Based Learning Pilot Programme</h4>
<p>This year, Yishun Secondary school took on a partnership with the Singapore
Symphony Orchestra (SSO) to be part of a pilot programme comprising a music
workshop and attendance at an SSO concert. The purpose of this pilot programme
is to aid in strengthening the local arts scene, in the SSO’s offerings
for students and youth in the future.</p>
<p>20 selected students from the Concert Band, Choir, Guzheng as well as
the lower secondary Music programme took part in a Music and Movement workshop
to better understand the Symphony pieces before going for the concert,
where they experienced the common motifs heard in the symphony through
active listening, the Dalcroze method as well as through interaction with
2 SSO musicians who were also playing at the concert itself.</p>
<p>At the concert, the students who were part of the workshop recognised
the motifs and were engaged in listening throughout the concert, enjoying
classical music in a way they never did before.</p>
