<h4>Programme:</h4>
<p><strong><u>Interdisciplinary and Inquiry-based Learning at Rifle Range Nature Park during Student Learning Fest (SLF)</u></strong>
</p>
<p>The Science Department adopted an interdisciplinary (Biology-Geography)
and inquiry-based approach to allow Secondary 4 and 5 Biology students
to appreciate three overarching ideas: (1) sustainability and conservation,
(2) relationship between humans and nature and (3) protection of species.
This was done through a pre-SLF lesson and learning journey at Rifle Range
Nature Park. Through the entire learning experience, students became well-informed
of Singapore's efforts in sustainability endeavors and witnessed the application
of science and technology in park management and conservation. Students
also gained emerging 21st century competencies as they worked in groups
to make sense of conflicting needs in Singapore (i.e. urban development
and environmental conservation) and to critically evaluate collected evidence.</p>

<p><strong><u>Secondary 2 Jiemin Primary School Science Outreach</u></strong>
</p>
<p>As part of the Secondary 2 science talent program, a group of 24 Secondary
2 students participated in Jiemin Primary School’s science fair on 26 June
2024. During the science fair, they explain science concepts that they
have learnt to the primary school students. The primary school students
also had the opportunity to do simple experiments and hands-on activities.
The primary 5 students enthusiastically participated in hands-on experiments,
where they explored concepts like electricity and chromatography.</p>

<h3>Achievements</h3>
<p><strong><u>Secondary 1 STEM Playground challenge</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Over the course of Term 1 and Term 2, our Secondary 1 students took part
in the STEM playground challenge jointly held by Science Centre Singapore,
The James Dyson Foundation and MOE (CPDD). The challenge required our students
to create a cotton reel using simple materials like rubber bands and toothpicks.
The challenge also required use to garner votes for a video posted on a
social media platform. A grand total of 15,716 students from 111 primary
and secondary schools participated. Yishun Secondary School has emerged
top 10 in the Secondary School Category.</p>

<p><strong><u>9th Singapore Junior Biology Olympiad (SJBO)</u></strong>
</p>
<p>SJBO is an annual Biology competition that pushes students to excel in
the discipline by incorporating practical skills and thinking approaches
in the study of Biology, and promoting critical thinking through application
questions. Months of revision culminated in an Online Theory Test where
students applied their learning by attempting a series of rigorous questions
of ‘O’ and ‘A’ level standards, as well as IBO standard. Out of thirteen
participants, Bernice Teng Kai Xin from Wong Zhi Hung from 4E1 received
the Honourable Mention Award for their stellar performance.</p>
<p><strong><u>Genetic Modification Advisory Committee (GMAC) Students Challenge 2024</u></strong>
</p>
<p>GMAC is a multi-agency national committee committed to its task in objectively
imparting scientifically-sound information on gene modification (GM) technology
and genetically modified organisms (GMOs) to the public. As part of its
ongoing public education efforts, GMAC organized the infographic Design
Competition based on the theme of “What is CRISPR-Cas9 Technology and its
Applications?” where two teams of Pure Biology students participated in.
The competition promoted active learning in our students and stimulated
students’ interest in science-based GM-related topics. The teams showed
commendable efforts in their research to ensure objectivity, relevance
and accuracy of scientific information when designing their posters. A
total of eight students received the Certificate of Participation Award.</p>
<p><strong><u>16th Singapore National Crystal Growing Challenge at National University of Singapore</u></strong>
</p>
<p>This is a biennial event for secondary school, junior college and polytechnic
students which was held on 25 May 2024. Steffi Wee from 3 Innovate, Khoo
Kang Zhe, Eugene from 3 Integrity, Mohamed Mubeen Mohamed Raseem from 3
Seek and Rathod Dhruv Dilipkumar from 3 Care and their teacher-mentors,
Ms Ng Puay Hoon and Mr Joshua Khong spent months growing crystals in the
school’s chemistry laboratory. This year, the students presented Ammonium
Copper(II) Sulphate Hexahydrate crystals for the Junior Category. They
received the Certificate of Participation Award.</p>
