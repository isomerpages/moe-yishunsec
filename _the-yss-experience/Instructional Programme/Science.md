<li>
<p><strong>Science Week 2025: The Power of the Tiny</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The inaugural YSS Science Week held from July 1 to 4 2025 embraced the
theme "The Power of the Tiny," spotlighting science at the (sub)microscopic
scale. A 2-day Science Carnival was held with booths featuring core science
disciplines and the Robotics CCA, and an exhibition by the Singapore Food
Authority (SFA). In addition, there was an assembly talk by a researcher
from A*star, a livestream with OceanX scientists, and a recess engagement
by the National Kidney Foundation (NKF). The week concluded with a prize
presentation ceremony celebrating the winners of the "Power of the Tiny"
Photography Competition and the Science Week Quiz.</p>

<p><strong>Interdisciplinary and Inquiry-based Learning at Rifle Range Nature Park during Student Learning Fest (SLF) </strong>
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The Science Department continued its interdisciplinary (Biology-Geography)
inquiry-based learning journey for Secondary 4 and 5 Biology students at
Rifle Range Nature Park, focusing on sustainability, conservation, and
the human–nature relationship. Students explored how Singapore balances
urban development with environmental protection and developed 21st century
competencies by evaluating evidence collaboratively. In 2025, the programme
was enriched with a new SLS wet-weather package featuring curated videos
by our Science teachers and NParks. While not activated this year, the
videos provided additional resources for students to deepen their understanding
beyond the on-site experience.</p>
<h3>Achievements</h3>
<ol start="3" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>STEM challenge #1 </strong>
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Our lower secondary cohort recently showcased their creativity and problem-solving
skills in the STEM Playground 2025 Challenge, jointly organised by the
Science Centre Singapore, MOE (CPDD), and the James Dyson Foundation. In
this exciting competition, students designed a boat powered by a chemical
reaction and competed against 121 primary and secondary schools across
Singapore. Through testing, refining, and improving their prototypes, our
students demonstrated resilience and teamwork. Their hard work paid off
as they proudly achieved 3rd placing in the secondary school category.
This remarkable achievement reflects their innovative spirit and passion
for applying science beyond the classroom.</p>
<ol start="4" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Jiemin Primary School Science Outreach </strong>
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Our Secondary 2 Science Talent Programme students recently took part in
an exciting outreach at Jiemin Primary School, where they engaged Primary
5 students through hands-on science booths. The activities included paper
chromatography, where colours were separated into beautiful patterns, copper
tape circuits, which introduced simple electronics in a fun way, and popsicle
stick catapults, where students applied physics to launch small projectiles.
This interactive session not only sparked curiosity and joy among the primary
students but also provided our secondary students with the chance to share
their scientific knowledge and hone their communication skills in making
science fun.</p>
<ol start="5" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Singapore Youth STEM Fair (SYSF) and 23rd Elementz Science Project Competition </strong>
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Eight lower secondary students displayed grit, perseverance, and innovation
as they took part in both competitions. Over nearly two months, they worked
tirelessly on research, project analysis, poster design, and presentations
to judges. The Secondary Two team investigated the strength and durability
of different types of bioplastics, while the Secondary One team explored
the growth rate of plants using handmade versus chemical fertilisers. Their
efforts shone through, with the Secondary Two team clinching the Accomplished
Award at SYSF and a Bronze Award at Elementz, while the Secondary One team
achieved commendation awards in both competitions.</p>
