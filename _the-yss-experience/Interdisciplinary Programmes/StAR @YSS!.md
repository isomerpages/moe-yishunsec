StAR @YSS!
==========

**StAR** (**S**tudents-**A**ll-**R**ise) Programme is part of Yishun Secondary School’s (YSS) **Project Enable** initiatives to support the Lower Secondary Normal stream students. A day in a week is set aside for them to experience a **school-based curriculum** that allows them to **seek** their interests, **strive** in their passion and soar for better educational outcomes (aligned to School Motto). This is an **uplifting** strategy so that these students stay committed and connected to the school and their learning experiences.

  

The programme-cycle commences with an **internal scan** to gather information on the overall learners’ profile through teachers’ feedback, student-surveys and focused group discussions. This is followed with an **external scan** to source for partners to match students’ interests. Weaved with **AfL and SEL Competencies**, students’ learning are measured, monitored and reviewed frequently.

  

Support from the school and **collaborations** with various community partners who believe in these students are contributing factors for the programme’s success. Through StAR, students are **engaged purposefully** and they acquire **a sense of achievement**. To share this journey with the fraternity, YSS welcomes teacher attachment and sharing at different platforms.
