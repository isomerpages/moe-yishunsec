**StAR**&nbsp;(**S**tudents-**A**ll-**R**ise) Programme is part of Yishun Secondary School’s (YSS)&nbsp;**Project Enable**&nbsp;initiatives to support the Lower Secondary Normal stream students. A day in a week is set aside for them to experience a&nbsp;**school-based curriculum**&nbsp;that allows them to&nbsp;**seek**&nbsp;their interests,&nbsp;**strive**&nbsp;in their passion and soar for better educational outcomes (aligned to School Motto). This is an&nbsp;**uplifting**&nbsp;strategy so that these students stay committed and connected to the school and their learning experiences.

  

The programme-cycle commences with an&nbsp;**internal scan**&nbsp;to gather information on the overall learners’ profile through teachers’ feedback, student-surveys and focused group discussions. This is followed with an&nbsp;**external scan**&nbsp;to source for partners to match students’ interests. Weaved with&nbsp;**AfL and SEL Competencies**, students’ learning are measured, monitored and reviewed frequently.

  

Support from the school and&nbsp;**collaborations**&nbsp;with various community partners who believe in these students are contributing factors for the programme’s success. Through StAR, students are&nbsp;**engaged purposefully**&nbsp;and they acquire&nbsp;**a sense of achievement**. To share this journey with the fraternity, YSS welcomes teacher attachment and sharing at different platforms.
