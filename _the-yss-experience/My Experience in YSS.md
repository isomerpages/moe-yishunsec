### Charis Global School (Jakarta) Immersion Programme in YSS

On the first day of Term 2, our school played host to a group of students and their teachers from Charis Global School in Jakarta, Indonesia, as they came for a one-day immersion programme.

Our Yishunites took on the role of buddies and brought their Indonesian counterparts around with them as they went about their day, providing the latter with a glimpse into the day of a typical Singaporean student. 

Our staff also engaged the Principal and teachers in professional development conversations, sharing best practices as well as looking into opportunities for exchange programmes in the future.

**Here are some of the reflections from our Yishunites about their experience:**

*"I really enjoyed this experience as I got to bond with not only my buddy but other students from Charis Global School as well. I learnt that in their school, there is only 1 class per Grade. I find it interesting how they do not use calculators in Mathematics. Instead, they do mental calculations. They speak multiple languages which I find very similar to us as we study our Mother Tongue languages too. This experience was very enjoyable and I learnt a lot of things, especially when I get to interact with students from other countries. Doing this also made me realise how getting to know different cultures is very important. All the students and teachers are really nice too. I really appreciate this opportunity and I learnt a lot of things!"*

*"I really enjoyed spending time with my buddy from Indonesia. We were both nervous at first but we were able to get along really well quite quickly. I think it was a nice experience to be able to spend a day with someone from another country and someone that I have never met before. We learned a lot about each other's cultures and how similar or different our lives are. It was definitely an interesting experience being able to share things about my school and life with my buddy and learn more about her as well. I introduced her to my friends and we shared many laughs and had a really fun time together. I definitely learned a lot about school life in Indonesia and I am sure she learned quite a bit about our school too. Overall it was a very memorable experience and I would love to do this again if I were given another chance."*

*"The programme was quite enjoyable. I managed to meet four very friendly teachers, two of whom were science teachers, and the others were an art teacher and a social science teacher. All of them were very curious about how our school worked. I had an interesting discussion with one of the science teachers. He told me what the education system is like in Jakarta, and I found that it is quite similar to Singapore. Oh yes, one of the ideas they really loved were the phone pouches in the classroom, where students kept their phones during lessons to avoid distraction during lerning. They even commented that it was quite a smart idea and gave a thumbs up to whoever who came up with that idea. Through the programme, I honestly felt that it was quite exciting and thrilling, especially to tell people about how it’s like for me."*

*"I enjoyed the whole experience as it got me to interact more with people and from outside of Singapore and I liked it as it made me become more comfortable in being able to speak with people I am unfamiliar with. I was also able to build friendships with people from a different country. Being able to have the opportunity to represent the school, show it off to people from outside the school and share what a great school YSS truly is gives me a great sense of satisfaction!"*

Marching of contingents from the uniformed groups and the ceremonial conducts of the observance ceremony.

Theme: **Stronger Together, Majulah!**
* Date: 8 August 2022 (Monday)
* Time: 07:35 am – 10:30 am

The National Day celebration returns in full swing to the parade square and hall this year. Centered around the theme ‘Stronger Together, Majulah!’, the commemoration encapsulates our hopes and spirit as a nation since our independence 57 years ago. It is a call for Singaporeans to strive for a better future and grow from strength to strength as we emerge from COVID-19.

Our school’s SAC Chairperson, Mr Andrew Foong and SAC Vice-Chairperson, Mdm Penny Ang were the invited guests for the celebration. The celebration started in the morning on Monday 8 August when our Uniform Groups cadets kick-started the observance ceremony at the parade square. The parade was led by the National Cadet Corps together with contingents from the other Uniformed Groups. This was followed by the singing of the national anthem and reciting of the pledge. After which, Mr Tay, our Vice-Principal, delivered the National Day message to the school. The segment ended on a high note with recitation of the ‘Recollections’ which reminded us of the challenges overcame by Singapore as a young nation.

Next, students immersed themselves in a craft activity in the classrooms to create coasters from red and white Perler beads. Students are reminded of the values of unity and equality of all races represented by the colours of the Singapore flag.

All staff and students congregated at the hall for the last segment. The concert segment was a manifestation of the vibrance of youth and diversity of Singapore. 

The school witnessed an eye-opening performance from NCC Precision Drill Squad (PDS) which showcased their rifle drills.

In conjunction with the 55th anniversary of National Service in Singapore, students were engaged through a sharing of personal stories and successes in the face of adversity from a SAF veteran who is a Commitment to Defence (C2D) ambassador. 

As part of the school’s recognition and affirmation to the efforts and sacrifices contributed by NSmen, an in-house ceremony to present the certificate of appreciation to staff who are NSmen currently serving the Operationally Ready National Service (ORNS) was carried out. The special moment inspires the students to play a part and contribute to the security and solidarity of our nation.

The concert band gave a spectacular performance which simulated the experience in a grand concert hall.

There was an air of excitement on the next segment as the contestants of the Vocalistic finals competition battled it out to give their rendition of yester year’s National Day songs. The results will be released during Teachers’ Day celebration.

The other concert items included a compilation of short videos on the hopes and wishes of Yishunites for Singapore. The pre-recorded video screening of ‘Dance of The Nation 2022’ workout by our very own teachers added the element of fun. 

Students were treated with an inspiring version of ‘We Are Singapore’ performed by our teachers in a duet, Mr Yeung and Mr Ong. A duet performance by Ahmad from class 1 Innovate and Chloe from class 1 Integrity singing the 2016 NDP theme song entitled ‘Tomorrow’s Here Today’ was another highly anticipated item. The next much awaited item was a dance number by the group formed by five students from Class 1 Soar and 1 Strive. The infusion of a Korean pop-song to the 2005 NDP theme song ‘Reach Out For The Skies’ was such a complement to the entire choreographed dance.

This celebration ended off with the community singing of the evergreen song ‘Our Singapore’ and this year’s National Day theme song ‘Stronger Together’. Despite being masked, Yishunites gamely sang along with much gusto to the rendition of the songs.

It is heartening to see students enjoyed the unique celebration and the togetherness shown in all the classes, embodying the theme for this year’s national day, ‘Stronger Together, Majulah!’.

Happy 57th National Day, Singapore!
