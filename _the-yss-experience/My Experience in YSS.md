YSS at the Nee Soon Central National Day Carnival 2022
------------------------------------------------------

On Saturday, 13 August, our NCC Precision Drill Squad, Indian and Malay dancers proudly represented YSS as we joined in the celebrations at Nee Soon Central’s National Day Carnival. Our performances were part of the festivities and were warmly received by the crowd.  Our students thoroughly enjoyed themselves and are proud to have contributed to the nation’s 57th birthday celebrations.
