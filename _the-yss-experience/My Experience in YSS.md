On Saturday, 13 August, our NCC Precision Drill Squad, Indian and Malay dancers proudly represented YSS as we joined in the celebrations at Nee Soon Central’s National Day Carnival. Our performances were part of the festivities and were warmly received by the crowd.  Our students thoroughly enjoyed themselves and are proud to have contributed to the nation’s 57th birthday celebrations.

Theme: **Stronger Together, Majulah!**
<br>Date: 8 August 2022 (Monday)
<br>Time: 07:35 am – 10:30 am

The National Day celebration returns in full swing to the parade square and hall this year. Centered around the theme ‘Stronger Together, Majulah!’, the commemoration encapsulates our hopes and spirit as a nation since our independence 57 years ago. It is a call for Singaporeans to strive for a better future and grow from strength to strength as we emerge from COVID-19.

Our school’s SAC Chairperson, Mr Andrew Foong and SAC Vice-Chairperson, Mdm Penny Ang were the invited guests for the celebration. The celebration started in the morning on Monday 8 August when our Uniform Groups cadets kick-started the observance ceremony at the parade square. The parade was led by the National Cadet Corps together with contingents from the other Uniformed Groups. This was followed by the singing of the national anthem and reciting of the pledge. After which, Mr Tay, our Vice-Principal, delivered the National Day message to the school. The segment ended on a high note with recitation of the ‘Recollections’ which reminded us of the challenges overcame by Singapore as a young nation.

Next, students immersed themselves in a craft activity in the classrooms to create coasters from red and white Perler beads. Students are reminded of the values of unity and equality of all races represented by the colours of the Singapore flag.

All staff and students congregated at the hall for the last segment. The concert segment was a manifestation of the vibrance of youth and diversity of Singapore. 

The school witnessed an eye-opening performance from NCC Precision Drill Squad (PDS) which showcased their rifle drills.

In conjunction with the 55th anniversary of National Service in Singapore, students were engaged through a sharing of personal stories and successes in the face of adversity from a SAF veteran who is a Commitment to Defence (C2D) ambassador. 

As part of the school’s recognition and affirmation to the efforts and sacrifices contributed by NSmen, an in-house ceremony to present the certificate of appreciation to staff who are NSmen currently serving the Operationally Ready National Service (ORNS) was carried out. The special moment inspires the students to play a part and contribute to the security and solidarity of our nation.

There was an air of excitement on the next segment as the contestants of the Vocalistic finals competition battled it out to give their rendition of yester year’s National Day songs. The results will be released during Teachers’ Day celebration.

The other concert items included a compilation of short videos on the hopes and wishes of Yishunites for Singapore. The pre-recorded video screening of ‘Dance of The Nation 2022’ workout by our very own teachers added the element of fun. 

Students were treated with an inspiring version of ‘We Are Singapore’ performed by our teachers in a duet, Mr Yeung and Mr Ong. A duet performance by Ahmad from class 1 Innovate and Chloe from class 1 Integrity singing the 2016 NDP theme song entitled ‘Tomorrow’s Here Today’ was another highly anticipated item. The next much awaited item was a dance number by the group formed by five students from Class 1 Soar and 1 Strive. The infusion of a Korean pop-song to the 2005 NDP theme song ‘Reach Out For The Skies’ was such a complement to the entire choreographed dance.

This celebration ended off with the community singing of the evergreen song ‘Our Singapore’ and this year’s National Day theme song ‘Stronger Together’. Despite being masked, Yishunites gamely sang along with much gusto to the rendition of the songs.

It is heartening to see students enjoyed the unique celebration and the togetherness shown in all the classes, embodying the theme for this year’s national day, ‘Stronger Together, Majulah!’.

Happy 57th National Day, Singapore!
