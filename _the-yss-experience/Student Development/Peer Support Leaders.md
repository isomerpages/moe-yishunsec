<h4>Recruitment</h4>
<p>This year, the Peer Support Leaders ran a combined recruitment campaign
together with the Prefects. They collaborated to present and publicise
the recruitment campaign to the student body. After the applications were
submitted, the Peer Support Leaders also worked together with the teachers-in-charge
to arrange for the nominees to come for interviews on different dates.
From role playing, to ushering and note-taking during the interviews, our
Peer Support Leaders were able to demonstrate their attention to detail
and showed how meticulous they were when given a task to execute.</p>

<p>Bubble Bump.</p>
<p>Most of our PSLs had fun during the Semester 1 Team Bonding session. Not
only did they have fun,they also made new friends in the PSL community
by playing the Bubble Bump. The event’s objectives were to allow PSLs to
get to know more about each other and step out of their comfort zone.Through
these activities, the PSLs had the chance to improve their teamwork and
communication skills with one another despite being in a bubble. It helped
the PSLs to learn new things such as looking out for their fellow PSLs’
safety and encouraging them to participate more during the activities.After
all, the Student Well-being teachers had spent much time choosing the activities
for the PSLs so that they could have fun.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the Semester 1 Team Bonding session was really fun and
engaging and I hope that we can have more opportunities like this in the
future.</p>
<h4>Peer Support Leaders in the Creative Movement Programme for Youths</h4>

<p>This study explores the impact of the Creative Movement Programme for
Youths, an initiative by EtonHouse Community Fund Limited, on the development
of the Peer Support Leaders (PSLs) in Yishun Secondary School over a period
of 8 weeks. The programme, designed to support the holistic growth of children
and youths, integrates movement-based activities to enhance emotional intelligence,
self-awareness, and interpersonal skills.</p>
<p>Participants exhibited notable improvements in their confidence when expressing
themselves in front of others. They developed a deeper understanding of
their peers' actions by recognising the emotional motivations behind them.
The PSLs also demonstrated heightened awareness of their own body language
as a reflection of their inner emotional states.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the programme equipped students with practical strategies
to manage stress and engage more empathetically with their peers. These
outcomes suggest that creative movement can serve as a powerful tool for
nurturing social-emotional competencies among youth leaders, contributing
positively to school environments and peer support systems.</p>
