<h3>Mission</h3>
<p><strong><em>To nurture students who are connected, competent and contributing members of the school and the community.</em></strong>
</p>
<p>The Educational Support consists of a team of officers who develop upstream
strategies to support High-Needs Students (HNS) through various intervention
programmes. These programmes also serve as important platform for students
to be connected with their learning experience, connected within the school
and the larger community through their hearts, hands and minds.</p>
<h3>(1) Connectedness with Learning Experience</h3>
<h5>(A) Students All Rise (StAR)</h5>
<p>StAR programme is conducted for our Lower Secondary Normal Technical (NT)
students on weekly Mondays (Marvellous Monday for the Sec 1s) and Fridays
(Fabulous Friday for the Sec 2s). There are infusion of Sports, Aesthetics
and S.T.E.A.M through modules such as the Toy-making, Aeronautics and F1
in schools. Different activities were carried out every term with the assistance
of external partners such as SHINE Children &amp; Youth Services, partnership
