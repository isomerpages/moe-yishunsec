<h3>CCA Goal</h3>
<p>To develop influential leaders with strong moral character.</p>
<h3>Thinker-Innovator-Contributor Highlights</h3>
<p>Planning and executing events take on a different mode this year with
celebrations going onto virtual space. In the production directed by our
prefects, Youth Day 2020: Vibrancy of Youth, staff and students showcased
their talents. The E-Concert for Teachers’ Day also served as a platform
for students to express their appreciation and understand more about their
teachers. The prefects also honed their leadership skills in leadership
workshops: DISC profiling, facilitation skills and temperaments profiling,
public speaking and project management.</p>
