### CCA Goal

To develop influential leaders with strong moral character.

### Thinker-Innovator-Contributor Highlights

Planning and executing events take on a different mode this year with celebrations going onto virtual space. In the production directed by our prefects, Youth Day 2020: Vibrancy of Youth, staff and students showcased their talents. The E-Concert for Teachers’ Day also served as a platform for students to express their appreciation and understand more about their teachers. The prefects also honed their leadership skills in leadership workshops: DISC profiling, facilitation skills and temperaments profiling, public speaking and project management.
